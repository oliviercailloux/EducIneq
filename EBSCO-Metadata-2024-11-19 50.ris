N2  - Using a randomized trial, we evaluate the impact of Liceo Jubilar, a tuition-free private school providing middle school education to poor students in Montevideo, Uruguay. The research compares adolescents randomly selected to enter the school with those not drawn in the school lottery. Several features of this school--the capacity to select personnel, a culture of high expectations, a safe and disciplined environment, differential teaching, extended instructional time, strong parental involvement, and a rich offer of extracurricular activities--contrast with the country's highly centralized public education system. We find large positive impacts of Liceo Jubilar on students' promotion rates and academic expectations. Our results shed light on new approaches to education that may contribute to improve opportunities for disadvantaged adolescents in developing countries.

N2  - Most OECD countries have seen income inequality increase over the past 25 years. The possibility that this may have been accompanied by rising inequality of opportunity triggers concerns about social justice and economic performance. This paper presents indirect evidence suggesting that the same factors causing overall income inequality to increase also are likely to have increased inequality of opportunity. Drawing on the experience of countries in the OECD and in Latin America, the paper concludes that greater fiscal progressivity and broad-based investments in education can be effective in reducing the inequality of opportunity without adverse effects on economic growth.

N2  - Population aging increases dependency levels and can influence the transition from working life to retirement. Changes in population structure have important economic effects, which can be positive when analyzing the impacts of a more educated older labor force but could also impact families and governments. It is important to consider how age and education composition are associated with each other in contexts marked by high levels of inequality. In this paper, we analyze the economic consequences of the aging process in Brazil considering the role of improvements in education and the possibility of the constitution of a silver dividend in the country. We use a series of simulation models, based on the determinants of labor supply and labor income of people aged 45 years and over, to investigate the impacts of changes in the educational composition of the labor force. Our simulations show that the positive association between education, labor supply, and labor income would be more pronounced in scenarios of higher levels of education, labor market stability (high status activities and informality reduction), and changes in retirement rules, specifically the establishment of minimum ages. Such a context would increase the number of older workers and improve productivity, allowing appropriate conditions for the development of a silver dividend in Brazil in a quantitative and a qualitative way.

N2  - This work investigates the performance differentials between students benefited and not benefited by the affirmative action policy of racial, social, and public education quotas in Brazil. The results were estimated using Oaxaca-Ransom decomposition and the recentered influence function regression model. The data are from the 2016-2018 Student Performance National Exam (Enade). The analysis shows that the performance difference between quota and non-quota students, in the mean, is small and not statistically significant in the upper quantiles, but this difference is high in the lower quantiles. For social and racial quotas specifically, there is a drop in the total performance differential along the distribution, making it insignificant in the upper tail. The quota policy provided access to higher education; however, it may still prove to be insufficient and specific actions directed at lower quintile students are needed in order to reduce performance differentials.

N2  - This paper uses a novel data set to quantify the difference in performance of public and private school students in an entrance test exam of the major public university in Brazilian Northeast (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco--UFPE). Although there are many public universities in Brazil, from our knowledge, there is no study that uses data on entrance test scores at such universities to evaluate the determinants of students' performance and the barriers for public school students to get in the good universities. The data set has detailed information on individual and school characteristics, and family background. We found that test scores of public school students are on average about 4.2-17% lower than those taken by private school students, depending on the set of controls. This result is robust when we address problems related to attrition, omitted variables (e.g., cognitive ability), and unobservable selectivity. We also show that once students get into the university, those from public schools perform as well as those from private schools. In addition, the proportion of public school students that gets into the university is roughly the same as the proportion of students doing the entrance exam. However, there is a strong barrier for public school students to get into high competitive majors. The fraction of students from public schools that gets into high competitive majors such as law, medicine, and electronic engineering is almost null. Our findings provide quantitative evidence to the common view that the Brazilian elitist high education system is an important channel for inequality persistence.

N2  - In May 2017 in Ecuador, the government of Rafael Correa handed over the presidency after 10 years and several mandates. His administration established the redefinition of the constitutional bases: the buen vivir cultural development and policy approach with a new transformative educational policy that sought to contribute to inclusion, overcoming inequalities, and poverty. His government benefited from high oil and commodity prices and broad popular support. This research has set out to review the results of the official national survey ENEMDU completed in December 2017. With a descriptive, bivariate, and multidimensional quantitative data analysis, we sought to shed light on the correlations between subjective poverty associated with buen vivir, school conditions, and ICT access and use of the school population in 2017. Results indicate a critical flaw in the buen vivir policies that failed to achieve their most valued and declared objective with indigenous and rural populations.

N2  - Persistent educational gaps due to differences in language exist in numerous countries, and research on policies to reduce these gaps is limited. This study examines the impact of a compulsory schooling policy implemented in 1994 in Paraguay--where Spanish and the indigenous language Guarani are both official languages--on the existing language-based educational gap. Paraguay is unique in that a majority of its population speaks some Guarani and that the use of Guarani is not associated with any particular racial or ethnic group. Combining differences in exposure to the policy with differences across language spoken suggests that the policy was associated with a 0.34-year increase in education for Guarani speakers (the language-disadvantaged group) relative to Spanish speakers (the language-advantaged group). This finding is robust to various empirical specifications and an event study analysis, suggesting that this type of policy may be an effective way to improve the schooling of language-disadvantaged students in similar country contexts.

N2  - The present paper explores the relationship between agrarian structure and human capital formation between and within Brazil's federal units. It is argued that whether states' agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap coerced labor, or organized around family farming matters for the formulation of educational policies. According to the main claim, landlords were not interested in paying higher taxes to educate the masses and curtailed the expansion of schooling in order to keep a cheap workforce and maintain their monopoly over the decision-making process. Describing several episodes in Brazil's history of public instruction, the paper stresses the distributional conflicts over education as well as the rural aristocracy's resistance towards broadly-targeted, citizenship-enhancing educational policies. The descriptive evidence is complemented by statistical analyses employing historical as well as more recent data. It is shown that states characterized by a more egalitarian land distribution, which are not under the dominance of powerful landlords, exhibit better educational coverage and enhanced instruction quality. They also spend more on schooling.

N2  - I analyze how two reforms, introduced to expand college access in Brazil, impacted enrollments of low-SES students. The first policy centralized applications in a nationwide platform (SISU), and the second expanded affirmative action quotas (AA) to a uniform share of 50 percent of vacancies offered by degree. Results show that SISU changes enrollment decisions of high-SES students, crowding out low-SES groups from the least competitive degrees disproportionately. In contrast, AA increases enrollments of low-SES individuals not only mechanically but also through behavioral responses. Finally, their interaction creates a complementary effect, protecting the low-SES groups from the crowding-out of centralization.

N2  - This paper estimates changes in the rates of return to human capital across the earnings distribution using data from over a 10-year period for Brazil. It uses these estimates to simulate the separate impacts of changes in returns to skills and changes in the supply of skills on earnings inequality. Evidence points strongly to growing inequality in rates of return to education in Brazil. This finding suggests that recent macroeconomic and trade reforms have been of most benefit to the skilled rather than the unskilled. Supporting evidence points to an improved competitiveness in the labour market, with workers increasingly rewarded for productivity. However, although increases in returns to education are more pronounced at the top of the earnings distribution, this did not in practice led to increased inequality. This is because levels of education and other labour market-rewarded endowments have increased and offset the rate of return effect. Appropriate education policy is therefore an essential partner for macroeconomic and trade reform if a developing economy is to avoid worsening income inequality.

N2  - Many countries use college-major-specific admissions policies that require a student to choose a college-major pair jointly. Given the potential of student-major mismatches, we explore the equilibrium effects of postponing student choice of major. We develop a sorting equilibrium model under the college-major-specific admissions regime, allowing for match uncertainty and peer effects. We estimate the model using Chilean data. We introduce the counterfactual regime as a Stackelberg game in which a social planner chooses college-specific admissions policies and students make enrolment decisions, learn about their fits to various majors before choosing one. Our estimates indicate that switching from the baseline to the counterfactual regime leads to a 1% increase in average student welfare and that it is more likely to benefit female, low-income and/or low-ability students.

N2  - School choice policies aim to increase educational access by weakening the link between a student's residence and his choice set, but long commutes and other barriers may constrain families from selecting otherwise-desirable schools. Leveraging a mass transit expansion in Mexico City's suburbs as a natural experiment, we find that a new train raised demand for elite and more distant schools, but only among high-achieving students with highly-educated parents. These students were also more likely to be assigned to elite and more distant schools under the test-based assignment mechanism. In contrast, we find little effect on the choices or assignments of low-achievers or those with lower-education parents. These results highlight the complementarities between transit access and school choice as well as the potential limitations of choice policies in large urban areas.

N2  - Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs to increase primary-school enrollment and attendance among low-income households have been shown to benefit children and households, but to date little is known about who joins such programs. We test three hypotheses about predictors of CCT program participation in indigenous societies in Bolivia, focusing on attributes of the household (ethnicity), parents (modern human capital), and children (age, sex). We model whether children receive a transfer from Bolivia's CCT program (Bono Juancito Pinto), using data from 811 school-age children and nine ethnic groups. Children from the group least exposed to Westerners (Tsimane') are 18-22 percentage points less likely to participate in the program than children from other lowland ethnic groups. Parental modern human capital and child sex do not predict participation. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying the findings and conclude that the Tsimane's current lower returns to schooling are the most likely explanation.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in Latin America and to assess Chile's anti-poverty policies, including Chile Solidario and the Ethical Wage. The paper has a summary evaluation of the most important CCTs in Latin America, an analysis of the nature and limited impact of Chile Solidario, a discussion of poverty and vulnerability in Chile, and the ethical wage approach pursued by the Pimera administration The paper concludes by questioning the capacity of market oriented approaches to poverty reduction and argues that because poverty is a multifaceted situation, poverty reduction requires a multidimensional approach that includes at the very least educational, employment, and labor policies.

N2  - Students' performance at the lower secondary level in Uruguay is examined on the basis of the mathematics scores compiled by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 2003 and 2006. An effort is made to analyse the differences in score distributions, to identify the variables influencing students' performance and to trace the trends over that period and weigh their significance. In order to do so, a production function for educational achievement is defined and a number of different decomposition methodologies are applied. The findings indicate that the small increase in scores between 2003 and 2006 is the net result of differing changes, most of which are primarily the result of an across-the-board increase in the school system's efficiency, especially in the case of public schools. However, this improvement is partially offset by reduced resource endowments and, in particular, unfavourable socioeconomic and cultural conditions in many of the students' households. Most of the changes that are analysed in this study are found to be of a redistributive nature.

N2  - The rise in wages inequalities, whatever may be the level of development reached, is linked to the modernization of countries, a modernization perceived as a constraint in an ever more globalised world. This tendency is sometimes thwarted by sustained education policies and by restrictive government policies aimed at raising low wages. But as a tendency, it is stronger when countries increase their opening rate and modify the exports structures toward ever more sophisticated products. One can see, however, how much it is artificial to separate technology from exports in order to measure their respective weight on the rise of inequalities.

N2  - This article provides evidence regarding differences in the performance on academic tests in secondary school between students who had attended preschool and those who had not. A non-parametric method based on the generation of counterfactuals to decompose gaps between observable and unobservable factors is used to analyse data gathered by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) between 2009 and 2012 for a number of Latin American countries. This analysis reveals the existence of socioeconomic segregation in terms of access; considerable score differentials (conditional on the controls used), which increase in line with the length of time spent in early childhood education; and significant differences across countries with regard to those differentials, which also tend to be greater in the case of reading test scores than in mathematics test scores.

N2  - This article analyses the challenges facing education in Latin America and its relation to labour market performance, against a background of severe long-standing income and social inequalities and now also the effects of globalization. It examines the degree to which higher educational attainment results in positive labour market outcomes (employment and earnings) and finds that, in spite of very large investments in education reform, the Latin American countries are falling behind their global competitors. Calculations made by the author of the education premiums in selected countries, by educational attainment and gender, show that labour market returns to education are positive or mixed but, in the case of unemployment, are often negative. The article suggests policies that could provide a more competitive labour force and more prepared human capital, and concludes with concrete proposals for confronting globalization.

N2  - Although the governments of the region have increased their spending on health and education, the results have been unsatisfactory. Expenditure on these services has traditionally been considered as a transfer rather than an investment. The accumulation of human capital has been relatively slow, with negative effects on economic growth, and it has been distributed unevenly among the different income groups, thereby further increasing inequality. This article analyses the causes of these results. First it describes the nature of the problem, presenting data which confirm the scanty and inequitable accumulation of social capital in the region, which has further accentuated the inequitable distribution of wealth and income. It then discusses the causes of these results, emphasizing the effect of the weak demand for education among the poor, due, among other reasons, to income constraints and the old policy of economic protection. Among its conclusions, it lays emphasis on the fact that the economic reforms have increased the demand for social capital, thus raising the private returns on investment in human capital and giving rise to renewed interest within the private sector in improving the public educational system. The public sector also has new incentives to embark on the reform of the health and education sectors. This could set up a virtuous circle of better accumulation and distribution of human capital, linked with more equitable economic growth.

N2  - This paper examines educational inequality in nine Latin American countries at the sub-country level from the 1950s to the 1990s. Educational inequality is measured by the difference in schooling years between the taller and the shorter half of the female population. Schooling years significantly increased across birth cohorts, especially before the 1980s, regardless of socio-economic stratum, region or country. However, educational inequality persisted. This finding reflects the achievement of the import substitution industrialisation era in educational development and its failure in mitigating the unequal distribution of education rooted in Latin America's social structure. Trade liberalisation and educational expansion are found to reduce educational inequality in capital and urban regions, whereas democracy and tax reform increased it. By contrast, educational inequality in rural regions was hardly influenced by policy changes. This finding urges future explorations into whether the persistence of educational inequality in rural regions is due to endemic social structure.

N2  - The regional concentration of poverty and the resulting disparities in living conditions create conditions where educational inequalities are intensified. These adverse conditions could lead teachers to refuse to work in disadvantaged locations that are characterised by high incidences of poverty and low-performing students. In this paper, we estimate how poverty in the districts where the schools are situated influences the probability that teachers accept a job offer in Costa Rica. Working with data on contract offers acceptance or rejection is a methodological novelty that makes it possible to dissociate students' poverty from the poverty of the schools' location. The estimation of a three-level hierarchical model allows us to deal with aggregation bias and unobserved heterogeneity. The results show evidence that district poverty is a key determinant of teachers' rejection of offers. Although the study uses data from Costa Rica, the results indicate more generally, how educational inequity can perpetuate poverty.

N2  - This paper studies the effects of school reform in Chile, which adopted a nationwide school voucher program along with school decentralization reforms in 1981. Since then, Chile has had a relatively unregulated, competitive market in primary and secondary education. It therefore provides a unique setting in which to study how these reforms affected school attainment and labor market outcomes. This paper develops and estimates a dynamic model of school attendance and work decisions using panel data from the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Encuesta de Proteccion Social survey. Some individuals in the sample completed their schooling before the voucher reforms were introduced, while others had the option of using the vouchers over part or all of their schooling careers. The impacts of the voucher reform are identified from differences in the schooling and work choices made and earnings returns received by similar aged individuals who were differentially exposed to the voucher system. Simulations based on the estimated model show that the voucher reform significantly increased the demand for private subsidized schools and decreased the demand for both public and nonsubsidized private schools. It increased high school (grades 9-12) graduation rates by 3.6 percentage points and the percentage completing at least two years of college by 2.6 percentage points. Individuals from poor and non-poor backgrounds on average experienced similar schooling attainment gains. The reform also increased lifetime utility and modestly reduced earnings inequality.

N2  - In this article, we study the construction of racial identity among students at a university that recently adopted racial quotas in admissions. Using data collected by the authors, we find that parents' race, family socioeconomic status, gender, and racial quotas have a significant effect on self-reported race. The evidence indicates that students in mixed-race families are systematically more likely to identify with their mother's race than with their father's. Conditional on skin tone quintile, higher socioeconomic status is associated with lighter racial self-classification, and lower socioeconomic status with darker racial self-classification. Additionally, the results demonstrate that being male is associated with lighter racial self-classification, and being female with darker self-classification. Policy changes may also affect racial identity. After the adoption of racial quotas, students in the darkest two quintiles were less likely to self-identify as branco, those in the fourth quintile were more likely to self-identify as pardo, and those in the darkest quintile were more likely to self-identify as preto.

N2  - This paper is an empirical investigation of inequality of education opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We use student scores from tests administered by the international consortium Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for a number of MENA countries and over time since 1999 to estimate the effect of circumstances children are born into on their academic achievement in science and mathematics. We find that inequality of opportunities explains a significant part of the inequality in educational achievements in most MENA countries, but there is ample heterogeneity. Family background variables are the most important determinants of inequality in achievement, followed by community characteristics. The results show that, despite great efforts in past decades to invest in free public education, most MENA countries are less opportunity equal in educational achievement than European countries, and several are less so than Latin America and the United States. From the variation in inequality of education opportunities across countries and over time we draw lessons on the influence of different education systems or changes in policy on equality of opportunity.

N2  - Brazil is characterized by a sharp consumption market and cultural activities across its distinct locations and social groups. With this in mind, this paper focuses on the relationship between supply of cultural facilities in Brazilian Metropolitan Regions (MR) and household expenditure on outdoor cultural activities through estimation of a two-stage (households and MRs) multilevel logistic model, using microdata from the Brazilian Consumer Expenditure Survey of 2002-2003 and 2008-2009. It was concluded that there is a strong concentration of expenditure distribution among different socioeconomic groups, and that expenditures on outdoor cultural activities (movies, concerts and arts) have demonstrated to be weakly correlated with the qualities of the different study Brazilian MRs, because greater variability of expenditure occurs within these regions. Thus, we also confirmed the hypothesis that recent advances in cultural policies have not been enough to reverse the inertia of inequality. Therefore, public initiatives in favor of cultural democratization, especially for inclusion of lower classes in cultural spaces, should consider the issue comprehensively, combining institutional supply issues, urban policy and public education.

N2  - This paper uses variation in school assignments generated by Mexico City's public high school choice mechanism to document a strong causal influence of older siblings on their younger siblings' school choice behavior. The effects of older sibling admission on the probabilities of choosing both the sibling's school and distinct but observably similar schools are large and positive, even when siblings are too far apart in age to attend school together. The evidence is more consistent with information transmission and path dependence channels than cost, convenience, sibling competition, or parental pressure. Sibling-induced changes in stated preferences affect admissions outcomes, including assignment to elite schools. The results imply significant externalities from policies such as affirmative action that alter the distribution of school assignments, as well as providing insight into the role of family networks in decision-making regarding educational investments.

N2  - The existing studies report substantial improvements in educational mobility in post-reform India using intergenerational regression coefficient (IGRC) across age cohorts in a cross-section survey. In contrast, our estimates of sibling (SC) and intergenerational (IGC) correlations for the same age cohort from two surveys show strong persistence, stronger than in Latin America, which remained largely unchanged from 1991-92 to 2006. Only the women in urban areas experienced substantial improvements, with the lower caste urban women benefitting the most. As measures of mobility, IGC and SC are more informative and robust than IGRC, and the widely accepted conclusions based on IGRC alone may be misleading.

N2  - Income inequality in Colombia showed an average reduction of 9.26% in the period 2008-2018. However, the Gini coefficient places Colombia as the second most unequal country in Latin America, with public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 4.5% (twelfth position), rising unemployment rates and modest secondary education provision. It is imperative to reflect on how resources are distributed and about mechanisms for reducing inequality. We test the hypothesis that spending on education reduces inequality, although not in an efficient way, while increasing provision of education generates differential effects. We estimate a panel data model that corrects for endogeneity for twenty-three departments of Colombia and Bogota D.C. The results suggest that education spending reduces inequality but is inelastic (B equals -0.05) and is associated with unproductive spending. In terms of education provision, early years education increases inequality, the secondary reduces inequality, while higher education is almost perfectly inelastic (B equals -0.004). The strategy for reducing inequality is not a general increase in public spending, but targeted increases and the strengthening of mechanisms for improving provision of education.

N2  - We present evidence that the recent fall Latin America inequality has been associated with higher social mobility across countries and over time. This correlation refers to what Alan Krueger and his CEA staff labeled the Great Gatsby Curve, but this is one of the first papers to test the Gatsby correlation over time. Our search for Gatsby curve correlates starts with classic mobility models where high Mincer coefficients and skilled wage-premia enhance wealthier parents' ability to impart advantage to their children. We also refer to Gary Solon and others' updates of their model to emphasize the potential of social policy to assist low-income children. Using Andersen's education mobility measure for teens over a panel of sixteen Latin American economies we test the robustness and correlates of mobility and inequality. We find higher social expenditure, access to credit and particularly conditional cash transfers increase mobility as do falling skill-premia and lower returns to female education. More important, Latin American social policy designed to reduce poverty and inequality in the short run also increased education enrollments and therefore social mobility over the longer term. Hence we find falling inequality is associated with rising social mobility over twenty plus years and across sixteen Latin American countries, as the Great Gatsby curve suggests.

N2  - This study seeks to answer two questions: how and why has the distribution of labour income changed in Central America? and why does Costa Rica display greater equity? In order to answer these questions, a technique based on the estimation of earnings equations is used. The direction of the changes in inequality is not uniform and depends on the indicator used. Although only Costa Rica and Guatemala show an unambiguous deterioration in the 1990s, there are some phenomena common to all the labour markets studied that have contributed to increasing inequality. The most important of these is the increased dispersion of the number of hours worked, caused by increasing proportions of part-time and overtime workers in all countries. There are two main reasons for the lower relative inequality in Costa Rica: education is distributed more equally, and wage differences between rural and urban areas are smaller. These results suggest that public policies that universalize primary education and provide economic and social infrastructure to rural communities contribute to reducing inequality.

N2  - How does intergenerational educational mobility change under educational expansion? This paper examines this question in Mexico, which enacted two important school expansion plans between 1959 and 1992. Using the 2011 Mexican Social Mobility Survey, I analyze how intergenerational mobility changes under different phases of expansion reform, and how do these trends vary according to the particular stage of the schooling process. Main findings indicate that mobility patterns are not stalled across cohorts, as reproduction theories predict. However, they do not reflect equalization at all levels of education either, as modernization hypotheses anticipate. Expansion reforms, especially the "11-year plan," are associated with positive trends in mobility in primary and lower-secondary schooling, but also with a decrease in intergenerational mobility at higher levels of education. Thus, these findings are consistent with the maximally maintained inequality hypothesis.

N2  - How does intergenerational educational mobility change under educational expansion? This paper examines this question in Mexico, which enacted two important school expansion plans between 1959 and 1992. Using the 2011 Mexican Social Mobility Survey, I analyze how intergenerational mobility changes under different phases of expansion reform, and how do these trends vary according to the particular stage of the schooling process. Main findings indicate that mobility patterns are not stalled across cohorts, as reproduction theories predict. However, they do not reflect equalization at all levels of education either, as modernization hypotheses anticipate. Expansion reforms, especially the “11-year plan,” are associated with positive trends in mobility in primary and lower-secondary schooling, but also with a decrease in intergenerational mobility at higher levels of education. Thus, these findings are consistent with the maximally maintained inequality hypothesis.

N2  - The objective of this study is to examine intergenerational educational mobility (IEM) in Latin America from the equal opportunity (EOP) approach. To this end, using the Latinobarometro survey, a new technique is applied to measure the degree of overlap between the observed joint density of parents' and children's educational levels and the theoretical density corresponding to an EOP situation. The main results show a significant increase in mean IEM levels. However, there is no improvement in EOP measures among children of parents with the lowest levels of education.

N2  - Prior research on inequality in Mexico has largely centered on income, education, and job status, overlooking the compound impact on gender and generational disparities. This oversight limits our understanding of social mobility dynamics and prospects. This study contributes to this body of research by analyzing labor income and consumption inequalities between 1994 and 2014, incorporating unpaid care and household production from 2014, using National Transfer Accounts frameworks. The study reveals five main findings. First, an increase in the number of households with secondary education might not be enough to significantly reduce inequality, as the proportion of households with tertiary education remained unchanged between 1994 and 2014. Second, progress in reducing labor income and consumption inequality among educational groups stagnated or reversed by 2014. Third, substantial differences exist in labor income and consumption across socioeconomic groups, with men consistently earning more than women. Fourth, unpaid household production varies across educational groups, with women in the most educated group dedicating the least time to these activities, while men in this group contribute more than other groups. Lastly, unpaid care and household production plays a significant role for women, and if they were compensated, it could considerably equalize labor income across genders and socioeconomic groups. This paper emphasizes the critical role of education and the equitable valuation of paid and unpaid work in reducing economic disparities in Mexico across genders and throughout the economic life cycle. To address disparities, the study stresses the importance of expanding education and aligning labor markets accordingly.

N2  - The shock on human capital caused by COVID-19 is likely to have long lasting consequences, especially for children of low-educated families. Applying a counterfactual exercise we project the effects of school closures and other lockdown policies on the intergenerational persistence of education in 17 Latin American countries. First, we retrieve detailed information on school lockdowns and on the policies enacted to support education from home in each country. Then, we use these information to estimate the potential impact of the pandemic on schooling, high school completion, and intergenerational associations. In addition, we account for educational disruptions related to household income shocks. Our findings show that, despite that mitigation policies were able to partly reduce instructional losses in some countries, the educational attainment of the most vulnerable could be seriously affected. In particular, the likelihood of children from low educated families to attain a secondary schooling degree could fall substantially.

N2  - The present study uses estimations of the National Accounts system by age and socioeconomic status to analyze inequalities in human capital investment in children. Socioeconomic status is proxied by the household head's education; children are the population under age 21; human capital comprises education and health consumption of National Accounts. The estimates suggest that funding human capital requires the re-assignation of resources between ages and socioeconomic groups and makes evident the central role of government interventions in redistribution. Nevertheless, differences in investment are relevant primarily because of investments funded with private resources. Estimates suggest that the improvement in socioeconomic level has different effects on the destination of resources allocated to children according to the starting level: first, consumption increases, then investment in education, and finally, investment in health.

N2  - The early establishment and persistence of landholding inequality is linked to poor long-run development outcomes. One crucial channel runs through human capital: large landowners historically underinvested in public goods such as schools, restricted workers and their children from to attending school, and extracted surplus from laborers that could have been invested in human capital. By equalizing landholdings, land redistribution should facilitate human capital accumulation. Using original data on land reform across Peru in the 1970s paired with household surveys, we conduct an age cohort analysis and find instead that higher exposure to land reform negatively impacted educational attainment as measured by the number of years of school attended. The driving mechanisms appear to be economic opportunity as well as income and child labor: individuals exposed to land reform are more likely to remain in rural areas and to have their children contribute labor to agriculture, driving down income in the long term.

N2  - Long regarded as a region beset by macroeconomic instability, high inflation, and excessive poverty and inequality, Latin America has undergone a major transformation over the last 20 years. The region has seen improved macroeconomic management and substantial and sustained reductions in poverty and inequality. In this paper, we argue that social policy, including human capital and education, social insurance, and redistribution, need special attention if achievements of the last two decades are to be sustained and amplified. Starting in the mid 1990s, many governments in the region introduced a variety of programs, including noncontributory pensions and health insurance, and cash transfers targeted to the poor. Social spending in Latin America increased sharply. These policies have been widely praised, and we believe they have resulted in substantial improvements in the lives of the poor in the region. However, a more nuanced view shows some worrisome trends. Moving forward, we believe it is necessary to pay much closer attention to the quality of services, particularly in education; to the incentives generated by the interplay of some programs, particularly in the labor market; to a more balanced intertemporal distribution of benefits, particularly between young and old; and to sustainable sources of finance, particularly to the link between contributions and benefits.

N2  - Historically, Bolivia's society and education system have been characterised by marginalisation based on poverty, ethnicity and gender. The central objective of the Morales government is to redress this imbalance and create a society inclusive of all Bolivians so that they can 'live well'. Our article illustrates how, while the international development agenda sees gender equality as an important element for an egalitarian education system, the latest Bolivian education reform gives gender equality diminished importance in favour of the focus on interculturality. Applying an analytical framework that uses social justice theory and a strategic relational approach, this article explores the agency of teachers to effect social change in relation to gender inequalities in Bolivia. Our research approach is embedded within the interdisciplinary field of international development studies and used mostly qualitative techniques to examine teachers' strategies to act towards gender equality.

N2  - Because some developing countries have adopted the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project at the national level and others are planning to do so, the macro-implications of this idea can no longer be ignored. Accordingly, I examine whether or not full adoption of OLPC computers in primary schools imbalances the national education budget. Using a simple formula, I address this question in relation to Peru, Uruguay, Rwanda and several other countries. The results suggest tentatively that the OLPC proposal tends to be untenable in poor developing countries, tenable or untenable in middle-income countries and redundant in most rich countries.

N2  - Chile features a universal school choice system, in which a government voucher provides families an opportunity to send students to public or private schools of their choosing. Since its implementation in 1981, the amount of the voucher was flat without adjustments for family income, creating incentives for schools to enroll students from economically advantaged families. In 2008, a policy change adjusted voucher values by the poverty level of students and the proportion of poor students attending each school. We evaluate the effect of this policy on primary school students' standardized test scores, using time-distributed fixed effects models. We find a positive and significant effect of the means-tested voucher policy on Math and Language achievement. The effect is much larger among private-voucher schools serving poor children, and it increased over the years after the policy change, suggesting that schools require some time to realize the benefits of the policy. Our findings show that moving from a flat to a means-tested voucher improves achievement and equality.

N2  - The immigrant generation of children (1st, 2nd, or 3rd+) is an important predictor in children's academic outcomes in previous assimilation models. However, little is known about how maternal legal status may interact with the effect of children's generational status. Using a sample of 604 Mexican-origin children (aged 9-17) from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study, this study examined children's academic disparities across maternal legal status and children's immigrant generation. Specifically, we examined 1) any academic score differences by maternal legal status (documented vs. undocumented) for each generation; 2) any academic score differences by children's immigrant generation among children of undocumented mothers (first vs. second generation); and 3) the extent to which children's educational expectations explained their academic disparities. Results showed that second-generation children of undocumented mothers had lower reading scores than second-generation children of documented mothers. Unexpectedly, first-generation children of undocumented mothers performed as well as first-generation children of documented mothers; they also performed as well as second-generation children of undocumented mothers. Net of covariates, the low educational expectations of first-generation children of undocumented mothers provided only a limited explanation for their reading disadvantages compared to second-generation children of documented mothers and third-plus generation children. This research provides policy implications for more effectively integrating immigrant-origin youths.

N2  - This article studies the effects of the neighborhood in which a school is located on children's mathematics achievement in Chile. It uses data taken from a sample of 127,020 sixth grade students measured by the National Education Quality Measurement System [Sistema Nacional de Medicion de la Calidad de la Educacion]. The incorporation of a measurement of socio-economic polarization of the geographic environment, which is innovative in urban studies, allows us to qualify some critical aspects suggested in the academic discussion. A lagged dependent variable model is used, controlling for the score obtained by the same students in fourth grade. Using multilevel linear regressions, the results show positive effects related to participation in neighborhood organizations. One critical finding is that socio-economic polarization has a negative and significant impact on the educational achievement of sixth graders. The conclusions highlight the repercussions associated with acute inequalities in the neighborhoods, and speak to the importance of accessing dimensions which are more closely linked to cities' social structure.

Publication Type: Journal Article. Update Code: 20180419. 
N2  - In recent years, Bolivia has experienced a series of economic and political transformations that have directly affected the labor markets, particularly the salaried urban sector. Real wages have shown strong increases across the distribution, while also presenting a decrease in inequality. Using an intertemporal decomposition approach, we find evidence that changes in demographic and labor market characteristics can explain only a small portion of the observed inequality decline. Instead, the results indicate that the decline in wage inequality was driven by the faster wage growth of usually low-paid jobs, and wage stagnation of jobs that require higher education or are in traditionally highly paid fields. While the evidence shows that the reduction in inequality is significant, we suggest that such an improvement might not be sustainable in the long run, since structural factors associated with productivity, such as workers' level of education, explain only a small portion of these wage changes. This suggests that enhanced redistributive policies accompanied by long-term structural policies aimed to increase productivity and educational level should be implemented in order to maintain the trends.

N2  - A large body of literature has emphasized the elite capture of democratic institutions as the explanation for the low levels of spending on public education in many low-income democracies. This paper provides an alternative to that longstanding hypothesis. Motivated by new cross-country facts and evidence from Brazilian municipalities, we hypothesize that many democratic developing countries might invest less in public education spending because poor decisive voters prefer the government to allocate resources elsewhere. One possible explanation is that low-income voters could instead favor redistributive programs that increase their incomes in the short run, such as cash transfers. To test for this possibility, we design and implement an experimental survey and an incentivized choice experiment in Brazil. The findings from both interventions support our hypothesis.
