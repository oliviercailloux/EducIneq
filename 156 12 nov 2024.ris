N2  - This paper reviews the development of the Latin American welfare state since the conquest, illustrating how initial factor endowments arrested the development of inclusive social policies. With industrialization social insurance was expanded to urban working and middle classes, however, it took the debt crises of the 1980s, rather than democracy, to prompt the creation of effective social assistance policies in the form of Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs). Unlike previous social assistance policies, CCTs are better targeted to the poor, and have succeeded in increasing income while improving human development indicators. They have not, however, changed the essential paradigm of the Latin American welfare state, which is still characterized by a two-tier system: the rich have separate and better quality protection than the poor, as well as access to better health and education services. Thus, while CCTs are tranquilizers--some might even call them populism--they are not a cure for existing inequalities, and might even delay the creation of a truly inclusive welfare state.

N2  - The few studies that have examined the wage impact of education across the earning distribution have focused on high-income countries and show education to be more profitable at the top of the distribution. The implication is that education may increase inequality. Extending the analysis to 16 East Asian and Latin American countries, in Latin America we observe a pattern similar to that of Europe/North America (increasing wage effects), while in East Asia the wage effects are predominantly decreasing by earnings quantile. However, once the analysis is performed separately for the public and the private sector, it is revealed that the strongly decreasing impact of schooling on earnings in the public sectors of East Asian countries is responsible for the overall observed decreasing pattern, while the impact of schooling on earnings in the private sectors of these countries is non-decreasing.

N2  - In most Latin American countries, homicide rates are much higher than in developed countries. It increases in some countries, decreases in others, or stabilizes. It has grown strongly in a few cities but decreased significantly in others since the beginning of the year 2000. The drug traffickers and the evolution of criminal organizations play a special role. The causes of the increase and the reduction of violence are many and complex. To reduce violence when it reaches the level that we know in many Latin American countries is a bit like trying to do the squaring of the circle. That is the difficulty. There is a set of prerequisites to make a more cohesive society and to reduce violence: substantially reduce socio-economic inequalities to promote a more egalitarian income distribution, to develop primary, secondary, and vocational quality education, to invent the city policies, to improve the quality of institutions, including and especially that of justice and police, and to develop a policy of the city as was done in Bogota and as it is starting to be done in the "pacified favellas" in Brazil in contrast to what is observed in Mexico where repression is privileged and corruption is very high.

N2  - Most OECD countries have seen income inequality increase over the past 25 years. The possibility that this may have been accompanied by rising inequality of opportunity triggers concerns about social justice and economic performance. This paper presents indirect evidence suggesting that the same factors causing overall income inequality to increase also are likely to have increased inequality of opportunity. Drawing on the experience of countries in the OECD and in Latin America, the paper concludes that greater fiscal progressivity and broad-based investments in education can be effective in reducing the inequality of opportunity without adverse effects on economic growth.

N2  - This paper looks at the intergenerational transmission of opportunities for standard of living in Latin America. It proposes to study this question on the basis of an ordinal approach. This ordinal approach borrows recent ideas on the way to compare opportunity sets, that is, to rank matrices giving, for example, the distribution of individuals by level of education of their parents and the standard of living (income) of the group to which they belong. Such comparisons are based on the use of the concepts of rank and Generalized Lorenz Dominance. The empirical illustration is based on the data of the 2006 Latinobarometro survey which covered 18 Latin American countries and the standard of living of individuals (children) was derived from an algorithm allowing one to compute the order of acquisition of durable goods and access to services.

N2  - There is no doubt that the social-political-economic framework where the majority of Latin American countries are developed is the framework of inequality, poverty and lack of democratic guarantees. However, they also have a great human and economic potential. This article tries to show, starting from a reflection about the public politics, the situation of Latin America and Hispanic Caribbean in 1990 and 2002. For that, it uses the analysis of quantitative variables collected from IDH (PNUD), through multiple factorial analysis a technique able to contribute to the public actors with an analysis methodology capable to visualize the implications of some particular actions in different fields: health; education, development.

Our approach is based on new estimates of inequality and poverty that are derived from Atkinson's Pareto interpolation, which bridges the discrepancy between national income accounts and household surveys. This may serve to offset the statistical bias in the estimates of income inequality and poverty, and to better interpret national and regional socio-economic performance. The analysis is carried out in a comparative framework between the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region and the European Union (EU).

N2  - The present paper explores the relationship between agrarian structure and human capital formation between and within Brazil's federal units. It is argued that whether states' agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap coerced labor, or organized around family farming matters for the formulation of educational policies. According to the main claim, landlords were not interested in paying higher taxes to educate the masses and curtailed the expansion of schooling in order to keep a cheap workforce and maintain their monopoly over the decision-making process. Describing several episodes in Brazil's history of public instruction, the paper stresses the distributional conflicts over education as well as the rural aristocracy's resistance towards broadly-targeted, citizenship-enhancing educational policies. The descriptive evidence is complemented by statistical analyses employing historical as well as more recent data. It is shown that states characterized by a more egalitarian land distribution, which are not under the dominance of powerful landlords, exhibit better educational coverage and enhanced instruction quality. They also spend more on schooling.

N2  - Cash transfers have been demonstrated to improve education and health outcomes and alleviate poverty in various contexts. However, policy makers and others often express concern that poor households will use transfers to buy alcohol, tobacco, or other "temptation goods." The income effect of transfers will increase expenditures if alcohol and tobacco are normal goods, but this may be offset by other effects, including the substitution effect and the effect of social messaging about the appropriate use of transfers. The net effect is ambiguous. This article reviews 19 studies with quantitative evidence on the impact of cash transfers on temptation good expenditure, as well as 11 studies that surveyed whether respondents reported they used transfers to purchase temptation goods. We conduct a meta-analysis to gauge the average impact of transfers on temptation goods. Results show that on average cash transfers have a significant negative effect on total expenditures on temptation goods, equal to -0.18 standard deviations. This negative result is supported by data from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, for both conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs. A growing number of studies therefore indicate that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded.

N2  - This paper uses a critical framework integrating Capability, Feminist and Critical Pedagogic theories to challenge the reductive focus within sustainability discourses on the physical environment, and education's typical 'development' focus on economic growth. The paper presents three main arguments. First, it argues for holistic or ecological concepts of both 'development' and ESD, focusing on enlightened political participation, emancipation and social transformation as the basis of ecological sustainability. Second, it challenges the limitation of such agendas to wealthy countries while 'development education' thinking applied to poorer countries is almost entirely economic. Third, it explores the political educational mandate that flows from this position. The three arguments are developed by examining successes and shortcomings in emancipatory educational projects in South Africa, Latin America and the Arab world. These projects, previously documented, are analysed using comparative 'glocalization' tools to reveal context-specific ways that innovative vertical and horizontal collaboration has created responsive new forms of educationally-mediated politically sustainable 'development'--focusing on equality, particularly gender. The analysis shows that educating for ecologically sustainable development based on enlightened and equal political participation has no less a place in 'developing' countries than it does in richer ones although constraints, and therefore means, may be situationally distinctive.

N2  - This paper uses Demographic and Health Survey data from six Latin American countries to analyze levels and trends of inequality for two important non-income measures of wellbeing, children's stature and adult women's educational attainment. Our purpose is to determine whether the worrying trend of increasing income inequality in Latin America is also found in non-income dimensions of well-being. We find that it is not. Almost across the board, health inequality, measured by children's stature, and education inequality, measured by young women's years of schooling, have fallen in these countries in the late 1980s and 1990s, often dramatically. Further, by decomposing changes in non-income dimensions of poverty into shifts in the mean and changes in the distribution of health and education, we show that reduced inequality has contributed to significant reductions in education poverty, and to a lesser extent, health poverty. This, too, is a very different result from the income inequality literature.

N2  - This paper investigates the factors determining the extent of the problem of child stunting and its socio-economic distribution in eight countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. It does so using a methodology that allows a socio-economic inequality index (the concentration index) to be decomposed by the factors affecting it. In the countries analysed, household "wealth" (measured by an indicator of material well-being) and maternal education are the most important determinants in the distribution of child stunting. The biomedical factors considered may be important in explaining the level of stunting, but their contribution to explaining inequality is relatively small. Geographical, cultural, ethnic and idiosyncratic factors also play a limited explanatory role, one that apparently depends on their relationship to the distribution of the socio-economic variables mentioned.

N2  - This paper studies the impact of commodity exports on educational inequality. Using data from 33 Latin America and the Caribbean countries over the period 1965 to 2010, the empirical analysis shows that export expansion of commodities leads to higher levels of educational inequality. The results are shown to be robust to the consideration of many control variables, different measures of commodity exports, and endogeneity of export expansion in commodities. Given the importance of educational inequality for economic growth, our results suggest a potential role for policy intervention in balancing the trade-off between promoting the aggregation production of education and increasing export growth in low-skill sectors.

N2  - This paper explores the direct effect of an education expansion on the level of earnings inequality by carrying out microsimulations for most Latin American countries. We find that the direct effect of the increase in years of education in the region in the 1990s and 2000s was unequalizing; this result is expected to hold for future expansions if increases in education are not highly progressive. Both facts are closely linked to the convexity of returns to education in the labor market. On average, the estimated impact of the education expansion remains unequalizing when allowing for changes in returns to schooling, although the effect becomes smaller.

N2  - Latin America has been traditionally characterized as a region with high levels of income inequality. Since the early 2000s, however, inequality has started to decline in most countries, basically due to an expansion of the income share of the poorest deciles at the expense of the richest 10%. This paper addresses the question of whether the improvements are driven by long-term secular trends or structural changes which could be expected to continue to generate inequality-reducing effects for years to come; or alternatively, if the changes are driven by short-term variables which could move unexpectedly in the opposite direction and reverse the gains observed so far. From our statistical analysis, we conclude that the improvements are associated with both long- and short-term factors – with the short-term factors recently having greater inequality-reducing changes.

N2  - A reduction in the wage premium for skilled labor -and a consistent reduction of overall wage inequality-has played an important role in explaining the fall of income inequality in Latin America during the 2000-2014 period. Consistent with that pattern, wage inequality declined in Mexico since 2000. This paper investigates the possible channels on why the wages of high-skilled workers have declined. Using data from Mexican labor surveys for the period between 2000 and 2014, we investigate if the decline was driven by wages declining more sharply for younger or older workers. We find that wages of older workers declined and the decline was more pronounced the older the cohort. This would seem to support the hypothesis that older workers' skills became obsolete.

N2  - During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Uruguayan labor market showed a significant decline in wage inequality and in the incidence of labor informality, while similar changes also took place in other Latin American countries. These trends were observed in a period of strong economic dynamism. Most extended explanations for this declining inequality in the region have been centered on falling returns to education. The main goal of this paper is to present new evidence on the relation between informality and wage inequality through a RIF-based regression decomposition analysis which, besides confirming the relevant role of education, shows that the process of labor market formalization also played a significant role in the reduction of inequality in Uruguay, mainly through a price effect.

N2  - This paper studies recent inequality patterns and the distributional effects of schooling and job informality on wage inequality in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico during the 2002-2014 period. By means of a quantile regression framework, we decompose changes in the wage gap using several techniques including the Machado and Mata algorithm, the RIF regression unconditional quantile regression method and the random-coefficients quantile regression representation. Results show that the reduction in wage inequality is explained by the improvements in the lower part of the wage distribution in which the pricing rather than the composition effect explains most of the changes. We found that the composition effect of education was unequalizing, while their pricing effect was inequality reducing. Job formality favored relatively more workers in the lower part of the distribution and had an important pricing effect below the median for all countries, but only in the 2002-2008 period.

N2  - This paper studies recent inequality patterns and the distributional effects of schooling and job informality on wage inequality in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico during the 2002–2014 period. By means of a quantile regression framework, we decompose changes in the wage gap using several techniques including the Machado and Mata algorithm, the RIF regression unconditional quantile regression method and the random-coefficients quantile regression representation. Results show that the reduction in wage inequality is explained by the improvements in the lower part of the wage distribution in which the pricing rather than the composition effect explains most of the changes. We found that the composition effect of education was unequalizing, while their pricing effect was inequality reducing. Job formality favored relatively more workers in the lower part of the distribution and had an important pricing effect below the median for all countries, but only in the 2002–2008 period.

N2  - Has democracy promoted poverty alleviation and equity-enhancing reforms in Brazil, a country of striking inequality and destitution? The effects of an open, competitive political system have not been straightforward. Factors that would seem to work toward this goal include the voting power of poor people, the progressive 1988 Constitution, the activism of social movements, and governance since 1995 by presidents affiliated with center-left and left parties. Yet these factors have been counterbalanced by the strong political influence and lobbying power of organized interests with a stake in preexisting arrangements of social protection and human capital formation. An analysis of four key federal sectors, social security, education, health care, and public assistance, illustrates the challenges for social sector reforms that go beyond raising basic living standards to enhancing socioeconomic inequality.

N2  - Poverty in Latin America has gone down in the last decade. That fact was led by a set of key aspects: economic growth, labor market and its institutions, and social programs based on cash transfers. The purpose of this paper is to perform decompositions of changes in poverty that was taken place in Colombia from 2002 to 2012, and analyze how growth, redistribution, demographic changes, education, the labor market situation and the non-labor income, led to reduce of poverty. It is found that the main elements that have reduced the poverty in Colombia are growth of incomes and the increase in labor income, and recently the increase in employment rate and non-labor income.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to identify the determinants of trust in government in the Latin American countries, using a cross section of average labor market and social data of the 2007-2012 period. The methodology consists of the estimation of equations based on the application of Phillips and Hansen's cointegration least squares, using as independent variables labor market indicators, as well as those associated with public expenditures, institutional quality and others. The emphasis of this paper is to study the association between trust in government and economic and social variables. Results show that while inequality is an important determinant of trust in government, the rates of female self employment and quality employment have positive and negative impacts on trust in government. Male self and quality employment have no impacts. Citizens' perception that government is committed to combat poverty leads to increased trust in government. This is a topic that has not received attention in the literature.The main limitation of this study is the reduced size of the sample of 18 observations. It is concluded that increasing social expenditures and reducing inequality would be conducive to higher levels of trust in the government in the Latin American countries.

N2  - This study analyses digital inclusion in secondary education in the Tarija School District in the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the 2012-2013 school year, using the indicators in the Plan of Action for the Information Society in Latin America and the Caribbean (Plan of Action ELAC). This is an exploratory and descriptive analysis based on a sample of 311 students, 108 teachers and 15 school principals. According to the findings, teenagers use the Internet to look for information and entertainment; the expansion of mobile technology among them offers numerous educational opportunities; and insufficient training for teachers on how to integrate information and communications technologies (ICTS) into the learning process is a top challenge. The existence of ICTS in schools has been confirmed, but not their use. Local and national efforts are helping to reduce the digital divide and promote equality of opportunity for young people.

N2  - This paper reports evidence that the savings rate of the rich is higher than that of the poor in Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. On average, the difference between the fifth and fourth income quintile groups is 7 percentage points. No differences between income groups are found in Uruguay and the results for Argentina and Colombia are not robust to estimation alternatives. The key methodological step is to construct a measure of lifetime income. Current income is not a good proxy since it is affected by phases of the life cycle and transitory shocks. We implement a two-stage procedure based on the education level of the household head and the education level of his/her partner. Several robustness exercises are reported for different age groups, inclusion/exclusion of outliers and for a wealth index based on homeownership, home appliances and other household owned assets.

N2  - I examine the association between college education and left-leaning views in Bolivia using novel survey data. My findings suggest that college education is associated with left-leaning social preferences (college-educated individuals favor social equality and a tax system in which not everybody must pay taxes) but right-leaning individual preferences (they favor individual liberty and respect for private property). My results fit the connotation given to terms like progre or socialista caviar commonly used in Latin America to refer to educated individuals who consider themselves progressive, or even socialist, but admit and enjoy the benefits of individual liberty and markets.

N2  - This article provides evidence regarding differences in the performance on academic tests in secondary school between students who had attended preschool and those who had not. A non-parametric method based on the generation of counterfactuals to decompose gaps between observable and unobservable factors is used to analyse data gathered by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) between 2009 and 2012 for a number of Latin American countries. This analysis reveals the existence of socioeconomic segregation in terms of access; considerable score differentials (conditional on the controls used), which increase in line with the length of time spent in early childhood education; and significant differences across countries with regard to those differentials, which also tend to be greater in the case of reading test scores than in mathematics test scores.

N2  - The relation between the economy and equity has shown marked contrasts in Latin America over the past two decades. Increases in public spending have been reflected in advances in education, health and access to basic utilities. In contrast, the region has experienced weak labor market performance and limited advances in social security. An intermediate situation has characterized poverty and income distribution, where there has been important progress during the first decade of the twenty-first century after almost a quarter century of unsatisfactory performance. This panorama can be described as a process of human development with precarious employment and economic insecurity. It indicates that Latin America has found it easier to respond to the challenge of human development than to the reduction of inequality and the expansion of 'labor citizenship'.

N2  - This article analyses the challenges facing education in Latin America and its relation to labour market performance, against a background of severe long-standing income and social inequalities and now also the effects of globalization. It examines the degree to which higher educational attainment results in positive labour market outcomes (employment and earnings) and finds that, in spite of very large investments in education reform, the Latin American countries are falling behind their global competitors. Calculations made by the author of the education premiums in selected countries, by educational attainment and gender, show that labour market returns to education are positive or mixed but, in the case of unemployment, are often negative. The article suggests policies that could provide a more competitive labour force and more prepared human capital, and concludes with concrete proposals for confronting globalization.

N2  - Although the governments of the region have increased their spending on health and education, the results have been unsatisfactory. Expenditure on these services has traditionally been considered as a transfer rather than an investment. The accumulation of human capital has been relatively slow, with negative effects on economic growth, and it has been distributed unevenly among the different income groups, thereby further increasing inequality. This article analyses the causes of these results. First it describes the nature of the problem, presenting data which confirm the scanty and inequitable accumulation of social capital in the region, which has further accentuated the inequitable distribution of wealth and income. It then discusses the causes of these results, emphasizing the effect of the weak demand for education among the poor, due, among other reasons, to income constraints and the old policy of economic protection. Among its conclusions, it lays emphasis on the fact that the economic reforms have increased the demand for social capital, thus raising the private returns on investment in human capital and giving rise to renewed interest within the private sector in improving the public educational system. The public sector also has new incentives to embark on the reform of the health and education sectors. This could set up a virtuous circle of better accumulation and distribution of human capital, linked with more equitable economic growth.

N2  - We analyse the important role of education in economic development and social well-being of American countries, including indicators of gender opportunities for development as part of social well-being. In this regard we select some indicators which usually have a great importance for reaching improvements in social well-being such as Government effectiveness and voice of citizens, among Governance Indicators, and the indicator of interpersonal trust from World Values Survey. Regarding life satisfaction we analyse the correlations of three indexes with economic development and other variables. The USA and Canada have a clear outstanding position in average educational indicators and other variables, while only a few Latin American and Caribbean countries show values of education spending above World average. In spite of the UN declaration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) many American countries show very low levels of education spending for the period 2000-2007. Fostering international cooperation to finance education is of uppermost importance to achieve the MDGs in those cases, and to guarantee socio-economic development. Regarding economic and social equality of opportunities for Women we find also a positive impact of education. Finally we present some econometric models which relate life satisfaction with economic development, gender equality and other variables.

N2  - Regional economic differences in Colombia have persisted over time. The present study seeks to contribute to the debate on the territorial differences of the country through the identification of patterns of low coverage in both primary and secondary education between 1904 and 1958. The results, coinciding with other studies on income, show a tendency towards the formation of an educational cluster in the centre of the country and the existence of a human capital trap in the periphery. The results also suggest that there is a high correlation between fiscal capacity and enrolment rates. Finally, it can also be observed that territories with the highest enrolment rates are associated with high urban enrolment rates during the process of country-wide urbanisation.

N2  - The causes and consequences of the intergenerational persistence of inequality are a topic of great interest among various fields in economics. However, until now, issues of data availability have restricted a broader and cross-national perspective on the topic. Based on rich sets of harmonized household survey data, we contribute to filling this gap by computing time series for several indexes of relative and absolute intergenerational education mobility for 18 Latin American countries over 50 years and making them publicly available. We find that intergenerational mobility is, on average, rising in Latin America. This pattern seems to be driven by the high upward mobility of children from low-educated families; at the same time, there is substantial immobility at the top of the distribution. Significant cross-country differences are observed and are associated with income inequality, poverty, economic growth, public educational expenditures, and assortative mating.

N2  - This paper examines educational inequality in nine Latin American countries at the sub-country level from the 1950s to the 1990s. Educational inequality is measured by the difference in schooling years between the taller and the shorter half of the female population. Schooling years significantly increased across birth cohorts, especially before the 1980s, regardless of socio-economic stratum, region or country. However, educational inequality persisted. This finding reflects the achievement of the import substitution industrialisation era in educational development and its failure in mitigating the unequal distribution of education rooted in Latin America's social structure. Trade liberalisation and educational expansion are found to reduce educational inequality in capital and urban regions, whereas democracy and tax reform increased it. By contrast, educational inequality in rural regions was hardly influenced by policy changes. This finding urges future explorations into whether the persistence of educational inequality in rural regions is due to endemic social structure.

N2  - Background: Using standard fiscal incidence analysis and the new methodological developments by the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Institute, this paper estimates the impact of fiscal policy on inequality and poverty in sixteen countries in Latin America around 2010. Methods: With information on incomes, consumption, and other dimensions available in household surveys, and knowledge about the characteristics of the fiscal system, the CEQ method consists in allocating to each individual the burden of personal income and consumption taxes, and the benefits from cash transfers, consumption subsidies, and government spending on education and health. This process yields the pre-fiscal and post-fiscal income concepts of interest. These income concepts, in turn, are used to calculate the corresponding indicators of inequality and poverty. Thus, one can estimate, for each country, the impact of the fiscal system and each of its components on inequality and poverty. Since the methodology that was applied is the same, results are comparable across countries. Results: The countries that redistribute the most are Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. Guatemala, Honduras, and Peru are the countries that redistribute the least. Fiscal policy reduces extreme (income) poverty in twelve out of the sixteen countries. The incidence of poverty after taxes, subsidies, and cash transfers, however, is higher than market income poverty in Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, even though fiscal policy reduces inequality in these four countries. Contributory pensions have a heterogeneous effect on inequality and, contrary to some expectations, their impact is equalizing in nine of the countries. In the sixteen countries, spending on pre-school and primary education is equalizing and pro-poor (per capita benefits decline with income per capita). Spending on secondary education is always equalizing; it is also pro-poor in some of the countries. Spending on tertiary education is never pro-poor but it is equalizing in all the countries except for Guatemala. Spending on health is always equalizing but pro-poor only in some countries. Conclusions: Latin America presents a great deal of heterogeneity in the size of the state and the countries' capacity to use their fiscal power to reduce inequality and poverty. A higher share of social spending (to GDP) is associated with a larger redistributive effect but countries with similar, or even lower, shares of social spending show heterogeneous redistributive effects implying that other factors beyond size such as the composition and targeting of social spending (and taxes) are at play. It is important to emphasize that a higher redistributive effect is not necessarily a desirable outcome since in this article there is no estimation of the impact of redistributive policy on fiscal sustainability and efficiency. In some countries, the burden of consumption taxes is such that a portion of the poor are net payers into the fiscal system (before receiving "in kind" transfers in education and health). Governments should examine whether this undesirable effect could be avoided, or at least reduced, through an expansion of targeted cash transfers and/or reduction in the consumption taxes that are particularly burdensome for the poor.

N2  - The new mobilities of the Spanish are inextricably linked to the crisis and the way it impacts Higher Education. In the last decade, Latin America has been a leading destination for qualified young people who have been inserted into university systems in the region attracted by educational reforms and demand for graduate degrees. In the article the keys to such insertion within the framework of an unequal knowledge economy on a global scale are analysed, questioning the implications of the imperative of mobility that today has been elevated to a requirement of the academic career. The latter only conceals a form of precariousness that is prolonged over time, subject to the social, economic and political swings chained in the countries of origin, destination and transit. This is the case of Ecuador, which has gone from being a receiving country for university graduates to presenting a scenario of incorporation and uncertain permanence. This gives rise to different responses, among them, the return to Spain, the displacement to new destinations and the insertion in other labour or training activities in Ecuador. Based on a survey and in-depth interviews with Spaniards at Ecuadorian universities, as well as data from the Ecuadorian higher education system, the inequalities that arise in these mobilities, the role played by university policies and the dynamics of crisis that condition the displacements, are analyzed in this article.

N2  - The 2030 agenda for sustainable development makes it a priority for countries to reduce income inequality while ensuring that people have access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy. Up to date, research examining the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality remain scarce. To contribute to knowledge and policy, this study utilizes a comprehensive dataset for 166 countries to investigate the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality for the period 1990-2017. Utilizing a two-stage generalized-method of moment (IV-GMM) approach, the empirical results indicated that access to electricity reduces global income inequality, while access to modern and clean energy increase global income inequality. On spatial accessibility to energy, rural and urban electrification were found to reduce global income inequality; however, the estimated elasticity of urban electrification exceeds rural electrification. The results further revealed that access to electricity, modern and clean energy, as well as rural and urban electrification moderate the impact of economic growth and education to improve global income inequality. The findings also indicated that employment, economic growth, education, gender empowerment, industrialization, and health are some of the potential channels through which access to energy influences global income inequality. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the direct and indirect effect of energy accessibility on income inequality varies between Latin America-Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, and Europe & Central Asia countries. The findings are robust to alternative econometric estimators and different measures of income inequality. We, therefore, argue that access to energy is a pre-condition for improving global income inequality.

N2  - This paper is an empirical investigation of inequality of education opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We use student scores from tests administered by the international consortium Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for a number of MENA countries and over time since 1999 to estimate the effect of circumstances children are born into on their academic achievement in science and mathematics. We find that inequality of opportunities explains a significant part of the inequality in educational achievements in most MENA countries, but there is ample heterogeneity. Family background variables are the most important determinants of inequality in achievement, followed by community characteristics. The results show that, despite great efforts in past decades to invest in free public education, most MENA countries are less opportunity equal in educational achievement than European countries, and several are less so than Latin America and the United States. From the variation in inequality of education opportunities across countries and over time we draw lessons on the influence of different education systems or changes in policy on equality of opportunity.

N2  - This article analyzes the early Uruguayan school expansion in Latin America during the First Globalization. With the school reform of 1877, the Uruguayan school system became highly centralized with a strong state role in decision-making and the distribution of public funds. Information in the memories of "Direccion de Instruccion Publica", shows the significant growth of the school budget, concentrated in salaries and early shaped public education a highly feminized labor sector. Unlike other historical experiences, the public-school supply was concentrated in less prosperous territories while the demand for education in Uruguay was greater in economics richer regions. Another inequality was found in the type of school establishment. Rural schools were the most important in public enrollment, but only allowed to lower levels of education, resulting in relevant educational inequalities between Montevideo and the rest of territories.

N2  - Latin America is the region with the greatest inequality in terms of incomes. Thus, during the last years, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has showed concern about the obstacle that inequality causes in the human development of this region. Given that higher economic growth does not necessarily lead to the achievement of further progress social, development beyond income will be one of the most important UNDP's messages for its upcoming report for this region to be launched early 2016. In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional approach to study inequality in welfare in terms of the components of the Human Development Index of the UNDP--health, education and income--in the period 1980-2014. For this purpose we use the multidimensional inequality indices proposed by Maasoumi (1986) that can be decomposable into the between- and within-group inequality components.

N2  - In the Latin American context, Chile has the highest level of per capita income and the human development index, though the distribution of income is quite unequal. Unlike Uruguay, Chile has one of the more unequal income distributions of the region. In 2003, Chile had Gini Coefficient of 8.5 points higher than Uruguay. Using micro/simulations, the analysis shows that most of the difference regarding income distribution comes from the wealthier households, particularly those that belong to the top 2%. Those households get the greatest proportion of resources coming from non-labor income. At the same time, the difference in returns to higher education explains another 20% of the income differences between Chile and Uruguay. Social conditions such as social security benefits and the participation of women in the labor market are not significant to explain the differences between these countries. Finally, this paper shows that national account adjustment to income information in Chilean households' survey explains a third of the Gini coefficient gap between Chile and Uruguay, without the national account adjustment, the income distribution gap among both countries would diminish in three points from earlier estimation. Even though this significative reduction the reasons to explain the gap would remain identical than previous analysis.

N2  - Financial inclusion and education contribute to a country's development and economic growth. However, despite the significant efforts being made to increase access to financial products for women, a high percentage still do not have access to and effective use of formal financial services in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. This study analyzes financial inclusion (based on gender equality) in the countries studied using a pooled-panel ordinary least squares econometric technique. Furthermore, the impact of interactions between the level of study, use of technology, academic degree during the Covid-19 restrictions, number of credit borrowers, and number of borrowers with the interaction of the restrictions during the health emergency was evaluated employing the Gini coefficient and human development index (HDI). This study confirms that Latin America and the Caribbean countries can increase financial inclusion by changing their social aspects based on gender equality to ease using technology and access to credit. The results of this study are helpful for policy-makers in formulating and implementing policies that lead to action plans that reverse an exclusionary financial system, promote financial education, and empower women.

N2  - The benefit of growth experienced since 2000 in Africa has not been broadly shared. Poverty fell by only 8.0 percentage points between 1990 and 2010 compared to the targeted 28.3 percentage points by 2015. Although income inequality fell by 4.3 percent between 1990 and 2009, Africa remains the second most unequal region globally after Latin America and the Caribbean region. Fiscal policies play important roles in reducing poverty and inequality through such instruments as taxes, transfers and government spending. Countries with high fiscal space tend to have lower poverty rates than those with lower tax revenue to GDP ratios. Indeed, fiscal space alone tends to account for 16.5 percent of changes in poverty reduction. Institutions play an important role in increasing fiscal space in Africa. Countries with increasing participatory, transparent and accountable budgetary process tend to have stronger impact of fiscal space on poverty and inequality reduction. Although 29 countries recorded declines in the distributional effectiveness of their fiscal policies over time, the distributional impact rose by 35 percent or more in countries such as Angola, Mozambique, South Africa and Togo. This paper calls for enhancing the non-extractive revenues by diversifying revenues sources from the extractive sectors and improving progressive taxation in countries with high fiscal space and high income inequality. Heavy investment in quality and accessible education and health services, and social programs are also vital to reduce poverty and inequality in Africa.

N2  - This article outlines the development of gender disparities in education for 28 Latin American and Caribbean countries for the period from 1880 to 1949, using age heaping techniques. We explore in particular the hypothesis of a U-shaped development of women's education during economic development, i.e., a decrease in gender equality at lower levels of overall education, and increasing gender equality at higher levels. For the downward sloping part, we find some evidence, although this part is relatively small. The upward sloping part is strongly confirmed. We also find that non-Hispanic Caribbean countries had substantially lower gender inequality rates than Latin American countries. A second major contribution is to document the development of average numerical abilities (of both genders) in these 28 countries.

N2  - The author explores new forms of collaboration between European donor countries and countries in Latin America in support of education. Placed in the larger context of the European Union Development Aid policy, the focus is the Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) impact on projects in Latin America, which illustrate how to mainstream gender equality into education. For a closer understanding of this success, she examines the Basic Education Programme in Peru (PROEDUCA).

N2  - Drawing on an empirical and comparative mixed methods analysis of Argentina and Chile, this article investigates arguments about the role of ‘inclusive’ versus ‘exclusive’ industrial relations systems in promoting gender wage equity and enabling attractive wage returns to women investing in higher education. Our findings confirm the importance of Argentina’s inclusive industrial relations system in narrowing gender pay differences to a greater extent than Chile. Nevertheless, Chile’s industrial relations institutions are not wholly exclusive; its high-level statutory minimum wage has played a strongly distributive role in the 2000s and compressed wages in the lower half of the wage distribution. Also notable is the finding from quantile regression that highly educated women in high-paid jobs enjoy a larger wage premium in the class-equal Argentina than in Chile despite a far wider wage gap between low/high-educated workers in Chile overall.

N2  - This paper studies the impact of gender and ethnicity on educational outcomes in Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series-International (IPUMS-I) database. Using an estimation method analogous to difference-in-differences, the paper finds that gender-based differences in literacy, primary school completion, and secondary school completion are larger for minority ethnic groups compared to others, or ethnicity-based differences are larger for women compared to men. The findings suggest that the intersection of gender and ethnicity confers cumulative disadvantage for minority groups, especially in Latin American countries, with implications on the design of development programs.

N2  - The existing studies report substantial improvements in educational mobility in post-reform India using intergenerational regression coefficient (IGRC) across age cohorts in a cross-section survey. In contrast, our estimates of sibling (SC) and intergenerational (IGC) correlations for the same age cohort from two surveys show strong persistence, stronger than in Latin America, which remained largely unchanged from 1991-92 to 2006. Only the women in urban areas experienced substantial improvements, with the lower caste urban women benefitting the most. As measures of mobility, IGC and SC are more informative and robust than IGRC, and the widely accepted conclusions based on IGRC alone may be misleading.

N2  - This paper explores the inequality of numeracy and education by studying school years and numeracy of the rich and poor, as well as of tall and short individuals. To estimate numeracy, the age-heaping method is used for the 18th to early 20th centuries. Testing the hypothesis that globalization might have increased the inequality of education, we find evidence that 19th century globalization actually increased inequality in Latin America, but 20th century globalization had positive effects by reducing educational inequality in a broader sample of developing countries. Moreover, we find strong evidence for Kuznets's inverted U hypothesis, that is, rising educational inequality with GDP per capita in the period until 1913 and the opposite after 1945.

N2  - The swinging of the pendulum toward policies that enhance Latin America's insertion into the world economy diverted attention from domestic policies that continue to be essential for growth and development broadly defined. Six domestic policy areas are identified here: increasing domestic savings, implementing countercyclical fiscal policies, mobilizing public resources, investing in education, promoting employment, and reducing income inequality. The opportunity cost of not having devoted due attention to these issues throughout the 1990s is surely enormous, and for those countries still underplaying domestic variables, the longer the delay the greater the costs. The imperative of devoting more political capital to domestic strategies of development cannot be overstated--whether international financial institutions choose to emphasize them or not.

N2  - Taking advantage of consistent poverty and income inequality data for 12 Latin American countries between 1970 and 1994, we analyze the determinants of changes in the incidence of urban and rural poverty and in Gini coefficients over spells of years, stressing in particular the role of aggregate income growth. We find that income growth reduces urban and rural poverty but not inequality. We also find that income growth is more effective in reducing urban poverty if the levels of inequality and poverty are lower, and the levels of secondary education higher. We show that there is an asymmetry in the impact of growth on poverty and inequality, with recession having strong negative effects on both poverty and inequality. Since growth does not reduce inequality, economic cycles create ratchet effects on the level of inequality. However, post-structural adjustment growth is quite effective at reducing poverty, particularly if inequality is low.

N2  - We examined the diverse composition of young people aged 15-29 in Brazil who are not in education, employment, or training (NEET). The analysis shows the Brazilian NEET population's main characteristics by analyzing data from the 2014 National Household Sample Survey. The findings confirm significant socioeconomic heterogeneity in group composition, which allows identification of subgroups with different levels of social vulnerability. A considerable proportion of these young people are in this status due to structural issues and social inequality, and for another significant portion of cases, NEET status is not a problem in itself. Therefore, especially in Latin America where demographic transitions have resulted in large economically active populations, investigations of youth inactivity and risk of social exclusion among this group are warranted.

N2  - This paper provides the first evidence on the dynamics of immigrant students' achievement following their migration to Spain. Using the data from 2003, 2006, and 2009 wave of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we show that immigrant students tend to perform significantly worse than native students, but that their performance improves with time spent in Spain. Among immigrants, Latin Americans enjoy an initial linguistic advantage, which, however, does not help them to catch up faster. The rate of improvement is such that students who stay almost all their lives in Spain still perform worse than natives in all domains analyzed by PISA. To better understand this achievement gap, we decompose it into parts attributable to school quality and to family characteristics. We observe that most of the gap is explained by individual and family characteristics and that less than 15% of it can be attributed to differential school attendance. Overall, the evidence suggests that policies that do not target the learning environment in disadvantaged families are likely to have a limited impact on the native-immigrant achievement gap.

N2  - Income inequality in Colombia showed an average reduction of 9.26% in the period 2008-2018. However, the Gini coefficient places Colombia as the second most unequal country in Latin America, with public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 4.5% (twelfth position), rising unemployment rates and modest secondary education provision. It is imperative to reflect on how resources are distributed and about mechanisms for reducing inequality. We test the hypothesis that spending on education reduces inequality, although not in an efficient way, while increasing provision of education generates differential effects. We estimate a panel data model that corrects for endogeneity for twenty-three departments of Colombia and Bogota D.C. The results suggest that education spending reduces inequality but is inelastic (B equals -0.05) and is associated with unproductive spending. In terms of education provision, early years education increases inequality, the secondary reduces inequality, while higher education is almost perfectly inelastic (B equals -0.004). The strategy for reducing inequality is not a general increase in public spending, but targeted increases and the strengthening of mechanisms for improving provision of education.

N2  - How much do social spending and taxation contribute to achieving the goals of poverty reduction and expanding the access to education and health services among the poor? Standard fiscal incidence analyses applied to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay using a comparable methodology yields the following results. Direct taxes and cash transfers reduce inequality and poverty by non-trivial amounts in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay but less so in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. In Bolivia and Brazil indirect taxes more than offset the poverty-reducing impact of cash transfers. When one includes the effect of in-kind transfers in education and health valued at government costs, they reduce inequality in all countries by considerably more than cash transfers. Spending on public education and health services is broadly pro-poor, with the exception of tertiary education and the health component of the social security system.

N2  - In spite of a peculiar pattern of the age at first birth in Latin America, there is little research about the long-term trends in the timing of transition to motherhood at all stages of women's reproductive lives and across countries in the region. This paper examines the evolution of educational disparities in the age at first birth during the fertility transition in three Andean region countries: Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Using birth history information available in the latest Population and Housing Censuses, I estimate the first-birth age-specific rates disaggregated by various measures of education level, for cohorts born between 1945 and 1980. In all countries, educational expansion was accompanied by increasing rates of first birth before the age of 20 among women with below completed higher education, but the most drastic change occurred among women who dropped out of secondary school. Concurrently, the first-birth rates at the age of 20-29 decreased for women who achieved higher education; an evidence of an increase in the rates above the age of 30 among them started to emerge. A pronounced divergence in the first-birth timing between the educational groups occurred during the fertility transition. Comparison of a relative and an absolute educational level classification shows that the increasing disparities between the lowest and the highest educated women were similarly pronounced even when accounting for the changes in educational composition across cohorts. This paper discusses the potential factors behind the polarization in the age at first birth in the region. It argues that there is a need for policies encouraging not only secondary school entrance but also secondary school completion in the context of substantial educational expansion and high levels of school dropout observed in the region.

N2  - A variety of social and economic institutions have contributed to the decline in poverty and inequality in Latin America. We focus on the bank-SME nexus because of the importance of banks as a source of finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the potential role that SMEs can play as sources of innovation, employment, and in reducing poverty and inequality. Our regression analysis of data from World Bank (WB) surveys of firms in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico shows that firms that are smaller, newer, less technically advanced, and less well-located firms are more likely to report being credit constrained. The factors that did not count are executive characteristics such as gender, education, and experience in the sector, and firm performance or foreign ownership. Firms that worked with several banks, developed affiliations to business groups or were in trade and political associations were less likely to report credit constraint.

N2  - This article analyses the evolution of child stunting in seven Latin American countries during the 2000s, based on repeated cross-sections of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). The incidence of stunting differs from country to country, ranging from 27% in the Plurinational State of Bolivia to 6% in Brazil. The largest reduction in stunting took place in Peru, where it declined from 28% in 2007 to 18% in 2012. The decrease in Haiti is also noteworthy, from 29% in 2006 to 21% in 2012. Although all countries were able to reduce the incidence of child stunting, inequalities in child stunting evolved differently. Whereas in Brazil and Colombia inequality in child stunting decreased, in Peru and Bolivia it rose. In the rest of the countries, improvements in child stunting took place jointly with no statistically significant change in its inequality. Results from the decomposition analysis indicate that the unequal distribution in stunting is accounted mainly by the wealth index, and to a lesser extent, by maternal characteristics such as weight, education, and children ever born. Factors such as breastfeeding and diarrhoea exert smaller effects. In all countries, inequality in wealth was the main contributor to changes in stunting inequality, with equalizing or un-equalizing effects depending on the country.

N2  - We present evidence that the recent fall Latin America inequality has been associated with higher social mobility across countries and over time. This correlation refers to what Alan Krueger and his CEA staff labeled the Great Gatsby Curve, but this is one of the first papers to test the Gatsby correlation over time. Our search for Gatsby curve correlates starts with classic mobility models where high Mincer coefficients and skilled wage-premia enhance wealthier parents' ability to impart advantage to their children. We also refer to Gary Solon and others' updates of their model to emphasize the potential of social policy to assist low-income children. Using Andersen's education mobility measure for teens over a panel of sixteen Latin American economies we test the robustness and correlates of mobility and inequality. We find higher social expenditure, access to credit and particularly conditional cash transfers increase mobility as do falling skill-premia and lower returns to female education. More important, Latin American social policy designed to reduce poverty and inequality in the short run also increased education enrollments and therefore social mobility over the longer term. Hence we find falling inequality is associated with rising social mobility over twenty plus years and across sixteen Latin American countries, as the Great Gatsby curve suggests.

N2  - We evaluate how far away six Latin American countries stand from a normative goal of equality of opportunity for educational achievement in PISA 2006-2009. We work with alternative characterizations of types: gender, school type (public or private), parental education, and their combinations. Following Checchi-Peragine's (2010) non-parametric method, we find that inequality of opportunity for educational achievement in Latin America ranges from less than 1% to up to 25%, depending on the year, the country, the subject, and the specification of circumstances. These magnitudes are substantial with respect to what is found in comparator countries. Parental education and school type prove to be important sources of inequality of opportunity, contrary to gender. By means of sensitivity analyses, while most results show small to moderate variation in terms of magnitudes, in ordinal terms (rankings) they remain quite stable. Brazil stands out as the most opportunity-unequal country of the sample.

N2  - In this paper we measure inequality of opportunity in daycare and preschool services in Brazil. For this purpose, we construct an opportunity index that modifies the Human Opportunity Index proposed in the literature and used in Barros et al. (2009) to measure inequality in basic opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we construct an opportunity measure that includes not only attendance but also parental choice not to enroll children in daycare or preschool, using data from a supplementary questionnaire included in the 2006 version of Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD). The results show that there are large differences between our opportunity index and the Human Opportunity Index for children aged 0-3 years old and considerably smaller differences for children aged 4-6 years old, which suggests that preschool may be closer to a basic opportunity than daycare.

The results show that there is no evidence of horizontal inequity in the use of preventive and healing health care services. However, we found that groups such as indigenous, individuals with no health insurance, with no education and residents in the urban-coast show a lower probability of using both preventive and healing services.

N2  - This article analyses the factors that cause violence in Latin America. It argues that high levels of violence can not be reduced in the medium and long term just by repressive policies, and without fulfilling prerequisites that lead to a more cohesive society, among them: to reduce socioeconomic inequalities, to make a more equitable income distribution, to improve primary and university education quality, the quality of the institutions, especially justice and police, and to create new urban policies framed within "cultural solutions". And especially, to recognize the rights and values of those populations that have been ignored for a long time.

N2  - How does intergenerational educational mobility change under educational expansion? This paper examines this question in Mexico, which enacted two important school expansion plans between 1959 and 1992. Using the 2011 Mexican Social Mobility Survey, I analyze how intergenerational mobility changes under different phases of expansion reform, and how do these trends vary according to the particular stage of the schooling process. Main findings indicate that mobility patterns are not stalled across cohorts, as reproduction theories predict. However, they do not reflect equalization at all levels of education either, as modernization hypotheses anticipate. Expansion reforms, especially the “11-year plan,” are associated with positive trends in mobility in primary and lower-secondary schooling, but also with a decrease in intergenerational mobility at higher levels of education. Thus, these findings are consistent with the maximally maintained inequality hypothesis.

N2  - The objective of this study is to examine intergenerational educational mobility (IEM) in Latin America from the equal opportunity (EOP) approach. To this end, using the Latinobarometro survey, a new technique is applied to measure the degree of overlap between the observed joint density of parents' and children's educational levels and the theoretical density corresponding to an EOP situation. The main results show a significant increase in mean IEM levels. However, there is no improvement in EOP measures among children of parents with the lowest levels of education.

N2  - We estimate the relationship between parents' education and income and children's schooling in Uruguay (1982-2010), interpreting this as a measure of intergenerational social mobility. Using three methodologies we report that such mobility has decreased over time. Improvements in education in the 1980s and 1990s were unevenly distributed. Computing an index of inequality of opportunity, we show that for mandatory education, this has remained constant, and for non-mandatory education, the increasing trend in inequality observed during the 1990s stagnated in the early 2000s. Finally, using instrumental variables we find that entrepreneurship is associated with greater social mobility.

N2  - Countries with high income inequality also show a strong association between parents' and children's economic well-being; i.e. low intergenerational mobility. This study is the first to test this relationship in a between-country within-country setup; using harmonized micro data from 18 Latin American countries, spanning multiple cohorts. It is shown that experiencing higher income inequality in childhood is associated with lower intergenerational mobility measured in adulthood. Following the same methodology, the influence of economic growth and public education is evaluated: both are positively, significantly, and substantially associated with intergenerational mobility.

N2  - This paper aims to study the process of intergenerational income mobility in some Latin American economies (Brazil and Panama), which have been much neglected in the relevant literature. Like other countries in the area, Brazil and Panama have a stagnant economy coupled with high income inequality. Our rich dataset allows us to provide the most reliable estimates of intergenerational mobility, after controlling for a number of additional control variables which were unavailable in previous studies. We provide estimates broken down for different genders, age groups, locations, education of fathers. Our results are robust to different specifications and suggest that previous studies significantly overrated the extent of the intergenerational mobility in the countries considered. However, our figures are still compatible with an extremely low degree of social mobility. Moreover, we show that behind social immobility there is also a sluggish process of structural change and an insufficiently progressive tax system.

N2  - This article reviews evidence on intergenerational social mobility in Latin America. Results indicate that mobility is low in the region, even when compared with the United States and United Kingdom, which rank low on social mobility. The evidence also suggests high levels of immobility at the income distribution's lower and upper tails. While intergenerational education mobility have improved in recent decades, which may increase income mobility for younger cohorts, overall the region still presents lower intergenerational social mobility. Previous studies suggest that these results might be associated to social exclusion, low access to higher education, and labor market discrimination

N2  - The shock on human capital caused by COVID-19 is likely to have long lasting consequences, especially for children of low-educated families. Applying a counterfactual exercise we project the effects of school closures and other lockdown policies on the intergenerational persistence of education in 17 Latin American countries. First, we retrieve detailed information on school lockdowns and on the policies enacted to support education from home in each country. Then, we use these information to estimate the potential impact of the pandemic on schooling, high school completion, and intergenerational associations. In addition, we account for educational disruptions related to household income shocks. Our findings show that, despite that mitigation policies were able to partly reduce instructional losses in some countries, the educational attainment of the most vulnerable could be seriously affected. In particular, the likelihood of children from low educated families to attain a secondary schooling degree could fall substantially.

N2  - During the last decades, important policies have been implemented to incorporate women into the labor market and reduce persistent gender inequalities, trying to balance the time allocation between paid and unpaid work. We assess the Chilean case considering couples' time allocation with explicit consideration of intrahousehold bargaining power (relative wages and education). The Chilean case is interesting because we use the first urban national survey of time use, which could help understand gender differences in labor participation. For that, we estimate a demand model, specifically a Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model considering six time-consuming activities on weekdays and weekends. Additionally, we assess two hypothetic scenarios: a proxy to childcare availability policy and an increase in women's relative wages. We found that bargaining indicators are related to how individuals allocate their time, particularly the inverse relationship between the time allocated to housework and paid work. Moreover, we found that increasing women's bargaining power in wage terms could produce stronger labor force participation increments. Finally, our simulations show that while women can bridge the gap between paid and unpaid work, they continue to spend more time on domestic activities than men.

N2  - Observers have long noted Brazil's distinctive racial politics: the coexistence of relatively integrated race relations and a national ideology of "racial democracy" with deep social inequalities along color lines. Those defending a vision of a nonracist Brazil attribute such inequalities to mechanisms perpetuating class distinctions. This article examines how members of disadvantaged groups perceive their disadvantage and what determines self-reports of discriminatory experiences, using 2010 AmericasBarometer data. About a third of respondents reported experiencing discrimination. Consistent with Brazilian national myths, respondents were much more likely to report discrimination due to their class than to their race. Nonetheless, the respondent's skin color, as coded by the interviewer, was a strong determinant of reporting class as well as race and gender discrimination. Race is more strongly associated with perceived "class" discrimination than is household wealth, education, or region of residence; female gender intensifies the association between color and discrimination.

N2  - Sen's capability approach considers that the main goal of the development process is the expansion of individual and social achievements in a wide set of dimensions (Alkire, 2002). Based On this perspective, in the early years of the 1990 decade, UNDP launched the Human Development Index (HDI) to reflect, monitor, and rank countries. This index goes far beyond traditional cross-country rankings based exclusively on GDP, as it considers three key dimensions: health, education, and economic resources. Nevertheless, HDI is the result from an aggregation of synthetic indexes that reflect the average achievements and it is not sensitive to their distribution among the population. To overcome this limitation, different authors have recently proposed corrections to the traditional indicator. In this article, we present the evolution of human development in Uruguay between 1991 and 2002, measured by the traditional HDI and by three formulations that are sensitive to inequality. We use the methodological approaches proposed by Hicks (1997); Foster, Lopez-Calva AND Szekely (2005); and Chatterjee (2005). We find that the incorporation of inequality significantly modifies the evolution of human development in Uruguay. We also present a comparison of the ranking of Latin American countries in the dimension of access to economic resources. Important changes in their ranking are observed when the correction for inequality is considered. Our results indicate that inequality should be incorporated in order to improve human development assessments.

N2  - This work asks whether there is a supply-side story to be told about labor market outcomes in Latin America. We present stylized facts about the connection between the demographic transition and changes in education (the size and quality of the labor force), with labor supply, inequality, and unemployment. The main conclusion is that the neglected topics of demographics and education improve our understanding of the overall decline in employment, the changing pattern of unemployment, and the rise in wage inequality. By adding them to the well-established demand and institutional factors behind these outcomes, we can obtain a clearer picture about labor markets in Latin America.

N2  - Inequality and informality are two characteristic features of the labour markets of Latin America. However, since 2000 the region has experienced a trend towards labour formalization and a reduction in wage inequality. This article analyses the inflows to formality in four Latin American countries--Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru--and assesses their distributive impacts. This aspect is relevant given that the increase in formal wage earners was particularly marked and it is not possible to determine a priori the sign and intensity of the impact of formalization on wage distribution. Therefore, the link between the two dimensions--inequality and formality--is an empirical question. The results of this analysis show that labour formalization had an important equalizing effect in Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, but that this was not the case in Peru. Most of the existing literature focuses on the distributive impacts of the returns to education. This study complements the existing literature by showing how the improvement of working conditions contributes to explaining the decreasing trend of inequality observed in Latin America since 2000.

N2  - Inequality and informality are two characteristic features of the labour markets of Latin America. However, since 2000 the region has experienced a trend towards labour formalization and a reduction in wage inequality. This article analyses the inflows to formality in four Latin American countries — Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru — and assesses their distributive impacts. This aspect is relevant given that the increase in formal wage earners was particularly marked and it is not possible to determine a priori the sign and intensity of the impact of formalization on wage distribution. Therefore, the link between the two dimensions — inequality and formality — is an empirical question. The results of this analysis show that labour formalization had an important equalizing effect in Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, but that this was not the case in Peru. Most of the existing literature focuses on the distributive impacts of the returns to education. This study complements the existing literature by showing how the improvement of working conditions contributes to explaining the decreasing trend of inequality observed in Latin America since 2000.

N2  - This paper presents a new dataset of enrolment rates and grade distribution ratios (GDR) in Brazil between 1933 and 2010, in addition to enrolment rates and GDR of Brazilian states from 1955 to 2010. To our knowledge, there are no previous estimates of enrolment rates by states for such a long period in Brazil. Enrolment rates and GDR in northern and north-eastern states were meagre and comparable to the lowest Latin American performers, and even the most advanced Brazilian states lagged behind the early leaders of the region, such as Argentina and Uruguay, until the turn of the century. Given a certain enrolment rate, Brazilian states were expected to present lower GDR compared to Latin American countries on average.

N2  - Smart city initiatives in Latin America aim to harness information and communication technologies to make urban service provision and management more efficient, transparent and user-friendly. Latin American cities have been relatively slow to adopt such initiatives, but there is inter- and intra-urban variety in the region. We offer illustrative vignettes of Rio de Janeiro, Santiago and Medellin, which have experimented with different formats for smart city programme design, implementation and management. While top-down and flashier smart city projects in these cities reflect worlding aspirations on the part of urban elites, mixed and bottom-up approaches serve to provincialise and often informalise the initiatives in manners that destabilise elitism and more equitably distribute costs and benefits. One of the biggest challenges these cities share in developing smarter initiatives is inequality, given that most interventions are located in or benefit higher-income areas and actors. As instruments to provincialise the discourses and practices of smart cityness in the region, we propose that cities adopt the '6-Es smart cities framework' (efficiency, economy, ecology, equity, education and engagement) and mobilise public-private-people partnerships within city plans and implementation processes.

N2  - Long regarded as a region beset by macroeconomic instability, high inflation, and excessive poverty and inequality, Latin America has undergone a major transformation over the last 20 years. The region has seen improved macroeconomic management and substantial and sustained reductions in poverty and inequality. In this paper, we argue that social policy, including human capital and education, social insurance, and redistribution, need special attention if achievements of the last two decades are to be sustained and amplified. Starting in the mid 1990s, many governments in the region introduced a variety of programs, including noncontributory pensions and health insurance, and cash transfers targeted to the poor. Social spending in Latin America increased sharply. These policies have been widely praised, and we believe they have resulted in substantial improvements in the lives of the poor in the region. However, a more nuanced view shows some worrisome trends. Moving forward, we believe it is necessary to pay much closer attention to the quality of services, particularly in education; to the incentives generated by the interplay of some programs, particularly in the labor market; to a more balanced intertemporal distribution of benefits, particularly between young and old; and to sustainable sources of finance, particularly to the link between contributions and benefits.

N2  - I address the link between democracy and inequality in Latin America, analyzing whether the degree of democracy that birth cohorts experience during the course of their formative years is related to labor income dispersion later, in adulthood. For this, I measure inequality at the cohort level by using pseudo-panel data built from household surveys for fifteen Latin American countries (from circa 1995 to circa 2011) and measure democracy as the discounted cumulative value of the degree of democracy during the cohort's formative years. I find that cohorts that have higher discounted cumulative values of the degree of democracy show lower income inequality. However, the effect of democracy on income dispersion is driven by those cohorts that benefited from the surge of democracies that came to exist during the second half of the twentieth century. I also present suggestive evidence that education is one mechanism explaining these results.

N2  - The article "The first steps: policies for child development and education in Latin America" highlights the importance of investing in early childhood development in the region. The author, Juan Ponce, economist and director of FLACSO Ecuador, gathers updated evidence on educational and child development programs in the region. The book also analyzes policies related to basic education and emphasizes the importance of reducing inequalities throughout life through public policies focused on the early years of life. Different policies related to education and child development are discussed, such as breastfeeding, micronutrient programs, preschool education, and conditional cash transfer programs. Policies to improve the quality of education, such as infrastructure improvements and teacher training, are also explored. The evidence shows mixed results and emphasizes the importance of quality in interventions.

N2  - This article explores the matching patterns of same-sex and different-sex couples in Latin America. The authors apply economic theories of assortative mating to sexual minority individuals and analyze data from eight Latin American countries. The study reveals that same-sex couples tend to have larger age gaps, higher rates of racial heterogamy, and are more likely to have partners with different education levels compared to different-sex couples. The findings suggest that factors such as legal recognition, social attitudes, and fertility rates may influence these matching patterns. The article emphasizes the diversity within same-sex couples and highlights the need for further research to understand the implications of nontraditional partnerships on income inequality and intergenerational mobility.

N2  - This paper utilizes the most recent CGSS data to quantitatively measure the contribution of inequality of opportunities to the overall income inequality in China. It finds that 27% of total income inequality can be attributed to inequality of opportunities, i.e., the inequality component which is out of control for individuals. This ratio is as high as that found in most Latin American countries with high income inequality. The heterogeneity analyses show that the inequality of opportunities is even larger for low-educated and low-income groups. Furthermore, the paper empirically verifies three possible channels underlying the measured inequality of opportunities, including labor market discrimination, intergenerational education persistence, and family background effect. Policy suggestions are derived based on the empirical analyses, such as reducing labor market discrimination, balancing educational resources among different areas, making it more transparent in state sector recruitment, and lowering inequality by more progressive taxes and transfers.

N2  - This paper reviews the factors and mechanisms that have been driving inequality in Mexico and finds that educational inequality accounts for by far the largest share of Mexico's variation in earnings inequality. The contribution of inequality of education to inequality of earnings in Mexico is the second highest in Latin America after Brazil. The increase in earnings inequality, however, does not appear to be the result of a worsening in the distribution of education, although the income profile, which is related to the returns to schooling, has become much steeper.

N2  - This article examines multinationals' (MNEs) sustainability practices focusing on the SDGs in developing countries through studying sustainability reports of multinationals from China (CMNEs) and developed countries (DMNEs). Findings show significant differences in MNEs' approaches to the SDGs. DMNEs prioritise education, health and poverty, whereas CMNEs emphasise poverty, education and cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Conversely, inequality, hunger, consumption and production, oceans and peace, justice and strong institutions are poorly addressed. Most importantly, while contributing to sustainability, they foster inequalities among developing countries by over-focusing on China and India, against the pledge of Leaving No One Behind.

N2  - This essay offers a historical perspective on the economic reforms carried out by the Chilean civic-military dictatorship that governed the country between 1973 and 1990. The regime applied some of the earliest and most extensive neoliberal reforms in Latin America, which included labor flexibilization, the end to agrarian reform, capitalization of the countryside, and privatization of public enterprises in almost all sectors, including pension funds, healthcare and education. Unlike the rest of Latin America, after the mid-1980s these reforms produced high growth, although they generated economic inequality and the concentration of wealth. The reforms must be understood in the context of the ideological polarization of the Cold War, which meshed with an internal conflict between views favoring the free market on the one hand and state intervention on the other. This conflict grew after the Depression of 1929 until it could no longer be contained within Chile's frustrating political and administrative system.

N2  - This paper studies intergenerational mobility in Latin America and shows that, in addition to the well-documented fact that the Latin American income distribution is highly unequal, profound differences in opportunities persist from one generation to the next. Comparing final educational achievements for 18 Latin American countries, this paper finds that measures of the persistence in educational achievements across generations, such as beta- and partial correlation coefficients, are high. This persistence is correlated with high returns to education, relatively low progressivity in public investments in education, and inequality of opportunity. An index of inequality of opportunity (including dimensions beyond an individual's control such as race, gender and parental income background) is estimated at around 40%, which is high by international standards. The paper also explores country differences in intergenerational mobility. While in Costa Rica, circumstances explain below 15% of the observed variance in education, in Chile, they amount to almost half the explained variance. The findings imply that there is room for targeted redistributive policies that improve intergenerational mobility.

N2  - Latin America's persistent inequality seem to reflect the lack of specific policies to reduce income disparities. The present study uses econometric techniques to estimate the determinants of the income distribution in the region, in a context in which economic growth seems to coexist with the reduction of inequalities--thereby overcoming the "empty box syndrome" that characterized the region in the 1980s and 1990s. Using cross-section studies of a sample of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Latin America, along with panel estimations for 18 Latin American countries in the period 1990-2010, the article reveals the key role played by educational, institutional, and macroeconomic variables in the recent improvements. It also identifies the importance of fiscal action, through variables such as social spending, expenditure on education, capital expenditure, and an indicator of the progressiveness of the tax system.

N2  - This paper presents a simple model of resource allocation within the family. The model is based on two main assumptions: there are nonconvexities in human capital investments and parents cannot borrow to finance their children's education. The model shows that poor and middle-income parents will often find it optimal to channel human capital investments into a few of their children, thus creating sizable inequalities among siblings. The paper shows that the predictions of the model are consistent with the available evidence for three Latin American countries.

N2  - In Latin America the abandonment and dropout remain mainly affecting poor and vulnerable students of the various companies in compulsory basic education levels, as in the case of secondary school (Roman, 2009). This study explores the relationship between poverty levels and educational indicators dropout and completion rates at the secondary level by multivariate statistical analysis in the 106 municipalities of the state of Yucatan, Mexico. With Coneval, information poverty levels and indicators of school dropout and completion rates of SEP, we performed a categorical principal components analysis, exploring associations between poverty and schooling variables of municipalities, as well as their relationship to each municipality as appropriate. Our findings reveal that moderate poverty is associated with dropping out of both men and women. Also men are those returning to school again in moderate poverty levels unlike women, who do so as long as they are out of poverty. We present special cases of those municipalities with significant levels of extreme poverty, moderate poverty, and school dropout and completion rates. The findings confirm theories in Yucatan conditional support in communities where extreme poverty and opportunity program beneficiaries are able to maintain high levels of secondary education, while those in moderate poverty, students must turn to other alternatives such as enter the labor market or stay home for the benefit of the family economy dropout results.

N2  - On average, poverty and income inequality increased in Latin America during the 1980s. Forty-six percent of the increase in poverty took place in the cities of Brazil alone, though part of this reflects the migration of poor rural inhabitants to urban areas. There is strong evidence that both income inequality and poverty mirrored the economic cycle, rising during recession and falling during recovery. Economies that grew (e.g. Colombia, Costa Rica) performed better with respect to poverty and income inequality than those that stagnated. In particular, countries that failed to stabilize effectively (e.g. Brazil, Peru) experienced substantial increases in poverty. Educational attainment has the greatest correlation with both income inequality and the probability of being poor. From a policy standpoint, there is a clear association between the provision of education, lessening of income inequality, and poverty reduction.

N2  - The Eighties witnessed a reversal in the gradual decline of poverty which had taken place in Latin America since 1950. This paper discusses the factors behind such reversal and the macroeconomic, institutional and targeted policies needed for significant poverty over the medium term. In the past, poverty was mainly a rural phenomenon rooted in inequitable agrarian structures, limited access to education and a marked urban bias. In the Eighties, in contrast, while declining slightly in the country side, poverty rose significantly in cities, thus becoming mainly an urban phenomenon. This surge in poverty resulted from the interaction among a severe recession, contractionary adjustment policies and a permanent increase in inequality due to greater wealth concentration, erosion of the State's redistributive role and radical labor market changes. Poverty reduction will thus require not only a broadbased recovery and targeted social interventions but also institutional reforms involving labor and fiscal policies and land distribution.

N2  - It is known that in most countries, private school students outperform students in public schools in international assessments. However, the empirical literature recognizes that assessing the true effect of private school attendance requires addressing selection and sorting issues on both observables and unobservables. The existing empirical evidence on the private school effect mostly covers OECD and Latin American countries, with little evidence on other parts of the world. There is recent emerging country-specific evidence doubting the existence of a private school advantage. I use PISA 2012 data for Mathematics and two different methodologies to derive baseline and bias-corrected estimates of the private-dependent and independent school effect for 40 countries. A robust private school advantage is found only in a handful of countries. Public schools generally perform as well as private subsidized schools and outperform independent schools. Accounting for both peer effects and selection is necessary when evaluating school effectiveness, especially in the case of independent schools.

N2  - In recent years, several middle-income countries, including Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay, have increased the availability of early childhood education and care (ECEC) services. These developments have received little scholarly attention so far, resulting in the (surely unintended) impression that Latin American social policy is tied to a familialist track, when in reality national and regional trends are more varied and complex. This article looks at recent efforts to expand ECEC services in Chile and Mexico. In spite of similar concerns over low female labour force participation and child welfare, the approaches of the two countries to service expansion have differed significantly. While the Mexican programme aims to kick-start and subsidize home- and community-based care provision, with a training component for childminders, the Chilean programme emphasizes the expansion of professional ECEC services provided in public institutions. By comparing the two programmes, this article shows that differences in policy design have important implications in terms of the opportunities the programmes are able to create for women and children from low-income families, and in terms of the programmes' impacts on gender and class inequalities. It also ventures some hypotheses about why the two countries may have chosen such different routes.

N2  - Despite progress in improving secondary school completion in Latin America, a high proportion of young people from urban marginalised neighbourhoods continue to drop out. On the basis of in-depth interviews with young people in an informal settlement of the City of Buenos Aires, the paper aims to broaden the understanding of the processes that lead to school dropout in these neighbourhoods. It does so by examining what young people value being and doing, and how they interpret the value of secondary school in their own lives and contexts. The results point to the critical importance of the family in young peoples' processes of reasoning and decision-making, the complex interaction between capabilities, and the benefits of schools that provide social and emotional support to students and families. The paper argues that listening to the voices of young people can give significant insights for the design of policies to close the gap in education outcomes in segregated urban contexts.

N2  - Combining data from the last three editions of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) with a multilevel approach, we aim to assess the effect of Latin American schools on student attainment and identify factors that contribute to their performance. It is found that family background, students' characteristics and school community profile (peer effect) are paramount in explaining student performance. Regarding the school facilities, the disciplinary climate in the classroom and the existence and adequacy of pedagogical resources are the determinants that stood out the most. Moreover, the use of a multilevel approach is of utmost importance, since a considerable art of student performance variation is explained by differences among schools (school effect). Finally, the peer effect and the school effect suggest that the socioeconomic inequality in Latin American countries is quite important in determining the students' performance.

N2  - This paper makes use of data provided by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in order to provide a quantification of the level and evolution of school segregation by socioeconomic status in the world, and contribute to the discussion of its determinants. Results suggest that Latin America is a region with high relative school segregation, where segregation between public and private schools is relevant. Findings also indicate that school segregation by socioeconomic status is higher in those countries and periods in which inequality and enrollment in private schools are higher, while certain patterns of geographic localization also play a significant role.

N2  - After a decade of increasing wage inequality, this paper documents a sharp compression in the distribution of wages in Argentina and Chile during the 2000s. In Brazil, wage inequality has steadily declined since the early 1990s. Counterfactual exercises show that the evolutions of the schooling and experience premiums are key determinants of the decline in inequality. The 2000s witnessed a rapid decline in the schooling and experience premiums, at the same time as the working population was aging and becoming more educated. To understand these changes, the paper develops a model of imperfect substitution across experience and education groups and estimates the relevant elasticities of substitution. Changes in labor supply contributed significantly to the decline of the experience and education premiums, but are not enough to account fully for the observed changes. The demand for experience shifted in favor of younger workers, while the relative demand for college graduates declined during the 2000s.

N2  - Income inequality is a critical issue in both political and public debate. Educational attainment is a key causal factor of continuing inequality, since it influences human capital accumulation and, as a consequence, the unequal distribution of earnings. Educational inequality displays a racial dimension that is particularly persistent and difficult to eradicate through policy measures. Its roots lie in the colonial institution of slave labor, which was widespread in the US and Latin America up until the 19th century. However, the influence of slavery differs significantly across countries and between regions.

N2  - Latin America is the least egalitarian region in the world. A neo-socialist government in Ecuador prioritized the reduction of socioeconomic status (SES) inequalities. The generational economy is a framework to understand the economic lifecycle and to link demographic change with people's well-being. This article aims to uncover SES-driven inequalities in the generational economy of Ecuador: did public transfers modify them from 2006 to 2011? National transfer accounts (NTA) were disaggregated by SES quartiles, which were defined by the highest level of education attainment in each household. The accounts within SES quartiles were estimated using standard NTA methods. A pseudo-Gini coefficient summarized SES-driven inequalities by age and generational account. This secondary analysis was based on existing micro databases from the Ecuadorian NTA.

N2  - We examine how different spatial compositions affect the educational achievement in mathematics of 16-year-old students in Chile, a Latin American country with high inequality and one of the most segregated education systems in the world. Conceptually, we complement the literature on 'neighbourhood effects', which typically addresses the influence of concentrated disadvantage, by focusing on concentrated advantage and its influence on educational outcomes. We construct a panel with all school students who took a national standardized mathematics test in 2010, 2014 and 2016 in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. We complement it with survey data for the 52 districts of the Metropolitan Region, clustering the districts based on factors such as unemployment, economic inequality, access to services, experiences of violence and stigmatization. Our different identification strategies consistently show that concentrated poverty and affluence are both relevant for explaining educational achievement in mathematics above and beyond individual and school characteristics.

N2  - Using panel data-sets from Mexico and Chile for the first years of the twenty-first century, the authors examine the determinants of middle-class intra-generational mobility. The middle class is defined by means of a latent index of economic well-being that is less sensitive to short-term fluctuation and measurement error than standard measures of income. The authors find high rates of both upward and downward mobility in Mexico and Chile, indicating that the middle class has opportunities to move to higher levels of well-being but is also vulnerable to falling into poverty. In both countries, labour-market resources (education and occupational status of the household head and number of members in the labour market) are much stronger determinants of mobility than demographic factors, suggesting the importance of policies that foster human capital and protect workers from shocks. Rural middle-class households are substantially more vulnerable to falling into poverty and have little chance of advancing to upper classes than their urban counterparts.

N2  - This article analyzes the impact of PANES, a temporary social assistance program carried out in Uruguay between 2005 and 2007, on school attendance and child labour for children aged 14 to 17. We explore three potential explanatory channels: labour market outcomes, household income and awareness of conditionalities. Our research is based on a panel of PANES applicants. The data includes the administrative records of the program and two waves of a follow-up survey. Program effects are identified using regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference estimations. We were not able to identify any effect on school attendance or child labour for children aged 14 to 17 as a whole or by specific sub-groups. At the same time, we did not find any impact on household income or adult labour, which suggests that income substitution is not explaining the lack of results in terms of schooling. Neither could we identify differences in behavioral responses depending on the awareness of conditionalities. It therefore appears that either the design of the transfer scheme was not suitable to promote behavioral changes (lump sum per household; monthly payments to adults; conditionalities not enforced) or the determinants of school attendance for this age group are more complex and require complementary interventions.

N2  - This paper reviews the pattern of income inequality in Mexico since 1994. It shows that in the past few years there has been an important reduction in income inequality in Mexico, which has almost reverted the sharp increase in inequality observed between 1984 and 1994. Using a Gini decomposition exercise we conclude that labor income, transfers and remittances have all played an important role in this process. We also argue that the equalizing effect of labor income and the reduction of wage inequality in Mexico can be explained by a structural change in Mexico's workforce composition in terms of education and experience. In general, we conclude that the recent reduction of inequality in Mexico is due to the interaction of both, the market and the State.

N2  - Relative to other countries in Latin America, Brazil has high rates of taxation and large social spending. We estimate the redistributive effect of fiscal policy on income distribution and poverty in Brazil using household survey data that contain detailed information about many labor and nonlabor income sources, direct taxes paid, contributions to the pension system, transfers received, use of public education and health services, and consumption. On the spending side, we find that although Brazil has some well-targeted antipoverty programs, these transfers have relatively low per capita amounts and a large portion of direct transfer beneficiaries are nonpoor. As a result, inequality and poverty reduction are low relative to Brazil's spending. On the tax side, indirect taxes paid by the poor often surpass the direct transfer and indirect subsidy benefits they receive.

N2  - In contrast to most other low-fertility regions, a sharp decline in fertility rates at young reproductive ages in Latin America did not accompany the fall in period fertility to a sub-replacement level. Reconstructing period fertility rates by age, birth order, and level of education, we investigate changes in the age pattern of childbearing in four Latin American countries that experienced a decline in period total fertility rates below the replacement level in the early 2000s--Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. Our analysis shows that all four countries display a combination of continuing high rates of childbearing among adolescent women, with a parallel increase in first birth rates at later reproductive ages. This pattern is manifested by the emergence of bimodal schedules of first birth rates by age, especially in Chile and Uruguay. We show that this reproductive polarization is more pronounced than the bimodal profiles identified earlier in selected countries of Europe and the United States. We suggest that the Latin American low-fertility pattern is linked to a high level of income inequality and wide social status differences in the region that go hand in hand with a high rate of unplanned early pregnancies and births, especially among women with low levels of education.

N2  - Scholars of Cuba have long linked Afro-Cubans' fate to the revolutionary government. As the government's influence on people's daily lives has declined over the past decade, the question arises of whether Afro-Cubans have sustained the gains they achieved in the revolution's first 30 years; This article uses survey data, collected in December 2000 from 334 Cuban families in Havana, to assess the impact of the post-1993 economic reforms on rising racial inequality in Cuba. It asks whether racial inequities occur in accessing dollars through state employment, self-employment, or remittances, and whether educational gains are tied to higher income. Results indicate that the structural means through which racial discrimination was once virtually eliminated through equal access to education and employment, and through which income levels became equalized according to educational level regardless of racial group, has lost its equalizing force in contemporary Cuba.

N2  - Cash transfers (CTs) are now high on the agenda of most governments in low- and middle-income countries. Within the field of health promotion, CTs constitute a healthy public policy initiative as they have the potential to address the social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequalities. A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the evidence on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa, and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective CTs. Twenty-one electronic databases and the websites of 14 key organizations were searched in addition to grey literature and hand searching of selected journals for quantitative and qualitative studies on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health outcomes. Out of 182 full texts screened for eligibility, 79 reports that reported findings from 53 studies were included in the final review. The studies were undertaken within 24 CTs comprising 11 unconditional CTs (UCTs), 8 conditional CTs (CCTs) and 5 combined UCTs and CCTs. The review found that CTs can be effective in tackling structural determinants of health such as financial poverty, education, household resilience, child labour, social capital and social cohesion, civic participation, and birth registration. The review further found that CTs modify intermediate determinants such as nutrition, dietary diversity, child deprivation, sexual risk behaviours, teen pregnancy and early marriage. In conjunction with their influence on SDoH, there is moderate evidence from the review that CTs impact on health and quality of life outcomes. The review also found many factors relating to intervention design features, macro-economic stability, household dynamics and community acceptance of programs that could influence the effectiveness of CTs. The external validity of the review findings is strong as the findings are largely consistent with those from Latin America. The findings thus provide useful insights to policy makers and managers and can be used to optimise CTs to reduce health inequalities.

N2  - Latin America experienced a decline in household income inequality in the 2000s, in sharp contrast to growing inequality in other regions of the world. This has been attributed to macroeconomic policy, social spending, and increased returns to education. This paper explores this issue from a gender perspective by econometrically evaluating how changes in economic structure and policy have impacted gendered employment and unemployment rates, as well as gender inequality in these variables, using country-level panel data for a set of 18 Latin American countries between 1990 and 2010. Three variables stand out as having consistent gender-equalizing effects in the labor market: social spending, minimum wages, and public investment. Less important or consistent were the effects of external factors (such as terms of trade), economic structure, and GDP growth.

N2  - How much redistribution and poverty reduction is being accomplished in Latin America through social spending, subsidies, and taxes? Standard fiscal incidence analyses applied to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay using a comparable methodology yields the following results. Direct taxes and cash transfers reduce inequality and poverty by nontrivial amounts in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay but less so in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. While direct taxes are progressive, the redistributive impact is small because direct taxes as a share of GDP are generally low. Cash transfers are quite progressive in absolute terms, except in Bolivia where programs are not targeted to the poor. In Bolivia and Brazil, indirect taxes more than offset the poverty-reducing impact of cash transfers. When one includes the in-kind transfers in education and health, valued at government costs, they reduce inequality in all countries by considerably more than cash transfers, reflecting their relative size.

N2  - How much redistribution and poverty reduction is being accomplished through the tax system and social spending in Latin America? This paper summarizes results from applying a comparable fiscal incidence analysis to nine countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Using the Gini coefficient as an indicator, Brazil lowers income inequality through direct taxes and transfers the most and Guatemala lowers it the least. Public spending in education and health have higher equalizing effects than other transfers. Adding the effect of indirect taxes leaves poverty higher than market income poverty in Bolivia, Brazil, and Guatemala.

The analyses are based on data from the Encuesta Nacional de Calidad de Vida between 2008 and 2016. Two empirical strategies were compared to account for the lack of randomness in groups of beneficiary and non-beneficiary families: (i) non-experimental designs (linear and nonlinear models with cross-sectional and pooled data); (ii) quasi-experimental designs (Propensity Score Matching and Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment). The results were robust to the different empirical strategies and emphasized that: (i) transfers increase the perception of food insecurity and subjective poverty; (ii) conditionalities involve positive impacts on different indicators of subjective wellbeing, especially health and education; (iii) general impacts on the perceptions of life are nonsignificant, as a result of divergent impacts on the dimensions of the subjective wellbeing of families.

N2  - Two related measures of educational inequality are proposed: one for educational achievement and another for educational opportunity. The former is the simple variance (or standard deviation) of test scores. Its selection is informed by consideration of two measurement issues that have typically been overlooked in the literature: the implications of the standardization of test scores for inequality indices, and the possible sample selection biases arising from the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA) sampling frame. The measure of inequality of educational opportunity is given by the share of the variance in test scores that is explained by pre-determined circumstances. Both measures are computed for the 57 countries in which PISA surveys were conducted in 2006. Inequality of opportunity accounts for up to 35 percent of all disparities in educational achievement. It is greater in (most of) continental Europe and Latin America than in Asia, Scandinavia, and North America. It is uncorrelated with average educational achievement and only weakly negatively correlated with per capita gross domestic product. It correlates negatively with the share of spending in primary schooling, and positively with tracking in secondary schools.

N2  - According to the Peruvian Constitution, the legal minimum age for child workers is 12 years old, making it the youngest level in Latin America and among other continents. More than 2 million children in Peru are employed in agriculture, gold mines, as domestic workers and street sellers. Peru is one of the latest countries where conditional cash transfers have been implemented in Latin America. This paper addresses the debate on conditional versus unconditional cash transfers in enhancing school attendance and consequently eradicating child labour and the broader question of targeted versus universal approaches in basic rights and income. Factors such as household's vulnerability, which can potentially lead to child labour, are highlighted. This paper also examines the method of targeting and the exclusion of groups at greater risk such as street children and single mothers. It uses recent quantitative data from the World Bank and the Peruvian government (2011) and data collected from interviews with programme executives of United Nations agencies and NGOs. It concludes that the only sustainable way to enhance the life chances of Peruvian children is to create strong mechanisms of social protection, such as basic services and income, that are available to every household.

N2  - It has become common to compare racial inequality in the United States with a "Latin American" pattern of racial inequality in which egalitarian racial ideologies mask stark socioeconomic inequalities along racial lines. However, relatively few comparative studies exist attempting to analyze variations in degrees of racial inequality in the Americas. To stimulate further research in this area, the following study analyzes census data on racial inequality in unemployment rates, educational attainment, homeownership rates, and income in Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States. The results suggest that while Brazil is similar to the United States in displaying large levels of racial inequality in the areas measured, Cuba and Puerto Rico display significantly lower levels of racial inequality and Colombia falls in between, undermining conceptions of a monolithic Latin American racial system.

N2  - This paper presents evidence on a rise and fall in income inequality in Chile during the past two decades. We show that income inequality rises from 1990 to 2000 and then falls from 2000 to 2011. We perform simple but informative decompositions to figure out the contributing factors behind that dissimilarity in the behavior of inequality across those two subperiods. Our results are consistent with a story in which economic growth increases the demand for more educated workers, initially increasing inequality. However, those higher returns to education encourage agents to invest in higher education, producing a subsequent human capital deepening that reduces inequality at later stages of the development process.

N2  - This paper combines labor force survey data with trade and production data from 1988 to 1997 to examine the impact of trade on wages and employment in the Philippines's manufacturing sector. In contrast to findings typically reported for Latin American countries, data indicate that wage inequality in the manufacturing sector declined over a period in which trade liberalization was undertaken. This was despite the fact that reductions in tariff rates were largest in less skill-intensive manufacturing industries. There was also an absence of any secular rise in returns to higher education. Tariff reductions were associated with declines in industry wage premiums in capital-intensive industries. Moreover, these declines were largest for skilled workers. Tariff reductions have had an insignificant effect on both employment as well as average hours of work of full-time employees across industries. These findings are consistent with a scenario where workers in capital-intensive industries, especially the more skilled ones, earned rents prior to trade liberalization, which may have eroded these.

N2  - Society faces many challenges in promoting a just transition to a low-carbon economy, a transition that does not create or exacerbate injustices. Notably, the just transition can only be attained with new educational approaches which revolve around social, climate and environmental justice. This paper advances that for a just transition, the shift to a greener economy cannot be driven by the traditional neoliberal engine, which has captured educational practices. Rather, the necessary educational transformation needs the principles of critical pedagogy and the dimensions of justice provided by the JUST Framework. We bring these two important schools together and draw on the experience of the global periphery and Latin America in particular, to develop a unique theoretical framework that contributes to the literature on education for sustainable development. Therefore, this conceptual research provides a theoretical framework that should guide education for a just transition. This paper establishes what is referred to as CCR Education Framework which involves: Critical thinking about climate, environmental and social costs of fossil fuels; Coexistence with nature and the other; and Resistance against neoliberalism and other forces that jeopardise the just transition. The CCR Education Framework is a response to the question of what education needs to include to achieve a just transition. The paper also opens the discussion about the implications of the Framework in terms of teacher training and education and appropriate pedagogical approaches. The key theoretical advancements here is that education for the just transition must affirm the importance of teachers and students as agents of transformation, and promote critical educational practices and approaches which support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and which value the characteristics of justice (which include equity, equality, fairness, and inclusiveness) to build a curriculum that advocates sustainable growth and a societal just transition.

N2  - This article documents an inverse U-shape in the evolution of wage inequality in Latin America since 1995, with a sharp reduction starting in 2002. The Gini coefficient of wages increased from 42 to 44 between 1995 and 2002 and declined to 39 by 2015. Between 2002 and 2015, the 90/10 log hourly earnings ratio decreased by 26 percent. The decline since 2002 was characterized by rising wages across the board, but especially at the bottom of the wage distribution in each country. Triggered by a rapid expansion of educational attainment, the wages of college and high school graduates fell relative to the wages of workers with only primary education. The premium for labor market experience also fell significantly. However, the compression of wages was not entirely driven by changes in the wage structure across skill groups. Two-thirds of the decline in the variance of wages took place within skill groups. Changes in the sectoral, occupational, and formal/informal composition of jobs matter for the process of reduction in inequality, but they do not fully account for the fall in within-skill variance. Evidence based on longitudinal matched employer-employee administrative data suggests that an important driver was falling wage dispersion across firms.

N2  - Latin America is traditionally the region with the highest income and wealth inequality and the indigenous people are the most socially excluded group of the society. The obstacles they face on their way to becoming middle class are numerous. Markets sometimes operate in an anti-poor way, e.g. capital market imperfections. Next, many Latin American countries are agrarian societies with high land inequality. Also, indigenous people continue to have lower health and education indicators. Possible solutions should include state intervention in providing easier access to credit for the indigenous, land reform, health and education systems that are more universal and better targeting of social transfers.

N2  - This work helps to explain the determinants of wage distribution in Latin America in the 1990s. The study employs the basic model of wage variance decomposition developed by Fields (2002), on the basis of an estimated Mincer wage equation adjusted for selection bias, which enables quantification of the impacts of the different explanatory variables of wage inequality. One of the main findings is that education is by far the most important factor in wage inequality in the region. What is more, it has become more significant over time, even though the explanatory power of the model has remained stable.

N2  - We study the dynamics of wage inequality in Latin America in the past two decades. We find a consistent trend reversal in wage inequality in the region since the early 2000s: wage inequality fell across all countries in a way not predicted by the trends each country had experienced in the 1990s. The decline in wage inequality is explained by a disproportional expansion in the real hourly wage among low-paid workers, reducing both lower and upper tail inequality. About 40% of the observed reduction in wage variance was a response to the more equal wage structure, while the rest derived from a reduction in wage dispersion among workers with similar observable traits. The equalization of the wage structure in the 2000s is correlated with a reduction in the wage premium across education, experience, and place of residence. The reduction in the gender gap contributed, to a lesser extent, to the trend reversal.

N2  - We study the dynamics of wage inequality in Latin America in the past two decades. We find a consistent trend reversal in wage inequality in the region since the early 2000s: wage inequality fell across all countries in a way not predicted by the trends each country had experienced in the 1990s. The decline in wage inequality is explained by a disproportional expansion in the real hourly wage among low‐paid workers, reducing both lower and upper tail inequality. About 40% of the observed reduction in wage variance was a response to the more equal wage structure, while the rest derived from a reduction in wage dispersion among workers with similar observable traits. The equalization of the wage structure in the 2000s is correlated with a reduction in the wage premium across education, experience, and place of residence. The reduction in the gender gap contributed, to a lesser extent, to the trend reversal.

N2  - This paper provides new evidence of sharp differences in cognitive development by socioeconomic status in early childhood for five Latin American countries using a common measure of receptive language ability. We find important differences in development in early childhood across countries and steep socioeconomic gradients within every country. For the three countries where we can follow children over time, there are few substantive changes in scores once children enter school. Our results are robust to different ways of defining socioeconomic status, to different ways of standardizing outcomes, and to selective nonresponse on our measure of cognitive development.
