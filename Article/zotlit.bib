	abstract = {This work asks whether there is a supply-side story to be told about labor market outcomes in Latin America. We present stylized facts about the connection between the demographic transition and changes in education (the size and quality of the labor force), with labor supply, inequality, and unemployment. The main conclusion is that the neglected topics of demographics and education improve our understanding of the overall decline in employment, the changing pattern of unemployment, and the rise in wage inequality. By adding them to the well-established demand and institutional factors behind these outcomes, we can obtain a clearer picture about labor markets in Latin America.},

	abstract = {Latin America's persistent inequality seem to reflect the lack of specific policies to reduce income disparities. The present study uses econometric techniques to estimate the determinants of the income distribution in the region, in a context in which economic growth seems to coexist with the reduction of inequalities--thereby overcoming the "empty box syndrome" that characterized the region in the 1980s and 1990s. Using cross-section studies of a sample of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Latin America, along with panel estimations for 18 Latin American countries in the period 1990-2010, the article reveals the key role played by educational, institutional, and macroeconomic variables in the recent improvements. It also identifies the importance of fiscal action, through variables such as social spending, expenditure on education, capital expenditure, and an indicator of the progressiveness of the tax system.},

	abstract = {On average, poverty and income inequality increased in Latin America during the 1980s. Forty-six percent of the increase in poverty took place in the cities of Brazil alone, though part of this reflects the migration of poor rural inhabitants to urban areas. There is strong evidence that both income inequality and poverty mirrored the economic cycle, rising during recession and falling during recovery. Economies that grew (e.g. Colombia, Costa Rica) performed better with respect to poverty and income inequality than those that stagnated. In particular, countries that failed to stabilize effectively (e.g. Brazil, Peru) experienced substantial increases in poverty. Educational attainment has the greatest correlation with both income inequality and the probability of being poor. From a policy standpoint, there is a clear association between the provision of education, lessening of income inequality, and poverty reduction.},

	abstract = {In recent years, several middle-income countries, including Chile, Mexico and Uruguay, have increased the availability of early childhood education and care (ECEC) services. These developments have received little scholarly attention so far, resulting in the (surely unintended) impression that Latin American social policy is tied to a familialist track, when in reality national and regional trends are more varied and complex. This article looks at recent efforts to expand ECEC services in Chile and Mexico. In spite of similar concerns over low female labour force participation and child welfare, the approaches of the two countries to service expansion have differed significantly. While the Mexican programme aims to kick-start and subsidize home- and community-based care provision, with a training component for childminders, the Chilean programme emphasizes the expansion of professional ECEC services provided in public institutions. By comparing the two programmes, this article shows that differences in policy design have important implications in terms of the opportunities the programmes are able to create for women and children from low-income families, and in terms of the programmes' impacts on gender and class inequalities. It also ventures some hypotheses about why the two countries may have chosen such different routes.},

It shows that in the past few years there has been an important reduction in income inequality in Mexico, which has almost reverted the sharp increase in inequality observed between 1984 and 1994. Using a Gini decomposition exercise we conclude that labor income, transfers and remittances have all played an important role in this process. We also argue that the equalizing effect of labor income and the reduction of wage inequality in Mexico can be explained by a structural change in Mexico's workforce composition in terms of education and experience. In general, we conclude that the recent reduction of inequality in Mexico is due to the interaction of both, the market and the State.},

	abstract = {This article documents an inverse U-shape in the evolution of wage inequality in Latin America since 1995, with a sharp reduction starting in 2002. The Gini coefficient of wages increased from 42 to 44 between 1995 and 2002 and declined to 39 by 2015. Between 2002 and 2015, the 90/10 log hourly earnings ratio decreased by 26 percent. The decline since 2002 was characterized by rising wages across the board, but especially at the bottom of the wage distribution in each country. Triggered by a rapid expansion of educational attainment, the wages of college and high school graduates fell relative to the wages of workers with only primary education. The premium for labor market experience also fell significantly. However, the compression of wages was not entirely driven by changes in the wage structure across skill groups. Two-thirds of the decline in the variance of wages took place within skill groups. Changes in the sectoral, occupational, and formal/informal composition of jobs matter for the process of reduction in inequality, but they do not fully account for the fall in within-skill variance. Evidence based on longitudinal matched employer-employee administrative data suggests that an important driver was falling wage dispersion across firms.},

We find a consistent trend reversal in wage inequality in the region since the early 2000s: wage inequality fell across all countries in a way not predicted by the trends each country had experienced in the 1990s. The decline in wage inequality is explained by a disproportional expansion in the real hourly wage among low‚Äêpaid workers, reducing both lower and upper tail inequality. About 40\% of the observed reduction in wage variance was a response to the more equal wage structure, while the rest derived from a reduction in wage dispersion among workers with similar observable traits. The equalization of the wage structure in the 2000s is correlated with a reduction in the wage premium across education, experience, and place of residence. The reduction in the gender gap contributed, to a lesser extent, to the trend reversal.},

	abstract = {This article analyses the challenges facing education in Latin America and its relation to labour market performance, against a background of severe long-standing income and social inequalities and now also the effects of globalization. It examines the degree to which higher educational attainment results in positive labour market outcomes (employment and earnings) and finds that, in spite of very large investments in education reform, the Latin American countries are falling behind their global competitors. Calculations made by the author of the education premiums in selected countries, by educational attainment and gender, show that labour market returns to education are positive or mixed but, in the case of unemployment, are often negative. The article suggests policies that could provide a more competitive labour force and more prepared human capital, and concludes with concrete proposals for confronting globalization.},

	abstract = {Although the governments of the region have increased their spending on health and education, the results have been unsatisfactory. Expenditure on these services has traditionally been considered as a transfer rather than an investment. The accumulation of human capital has been relatively slow, with negative effects on economic growth, and it has been distributed unevenly among the different income groups, thereby further increasing inequality. This article analyses the causes of these results. First it describes the nature of the problem, presenting data which confirm the scanty and inequitable accumulation of social capital in the region, which has further accentuated the inequitable distribution of wealth and income. It then discusses the causes of these results, emphasizing the effect of the weak demand for education among the poor, due, among other reasons, to income constraints and the old policy of economic protection. Among its conclusions, it lays emphasis on the fact that the economic reforms have increased the demand for social capital, thus raising the private returns on investment in human capital and giving rise to renewed interest within the private sector in improving the public educational system. The public sector also has new incentives to embark on the reform of the health and education sectors. This could set up a virtuous circle of better accumulation and distribution of human capital, linked with more equitable economic growth.},

	abstract = {Latin America is the region with the greatest inequality in terms of incomes. Thus, during the last years, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has showed concern about the obstacle that inequality causes in the human development of this region. Given that higher economic growth does not necessarily lead to the achievement of further progress social, development beyond income will be one of the most important UNDP's messages for its upcoming report for this region to be launched early 2016. In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional approach to study inequality in welfare in terms of the components of the Human Development Index of the UNDP -health, education and income- in the period 1980-2014. For this purpose we use the multidimensional inequality indices proposed by Maasoumi (1986) that can be decomposable into the between- and within-group inequality components.},

	abstract = {Income inequality in Colombia showed an average reduction of 9.26\% in the period 2008-2018. However, the Gini coefficient places Colombia as the second most unequal country in Latin America, with public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 4.5\% (twelfth position), rising unemployment rates and modest secondary education provision. It is imperative to reflect on how resources are distributed and about mechanisms for reducing inequality. We test the hypothesis that spending on education reduces inequality, although not in an efficient way, while increasing provision of education generates differential effects. We estimate a panel data model that corrects for endogeneity for twenty-three departments of Colombia and Bogota D.C. The results suggest that education spending reduces inequality but is inelastic (B equals -0.05) and is associated with unproductive spending. In terms of education provision, early years education increases inequality, the secondary reduces inequality, while higher education is almost perfectly inelastic (B equals -0.004). The strategy for reducing inequality is not a general increase in public spending, but targeted increases and the strengthening of mechanisms for improving provision of education.},

Standard fiscal incidence analyses applied to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay using a comparable methodology yields the following results. Direct taxes and cash transfers reduce inequality and poverty by non-trivial amounts in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay but less so in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. In Bolivia and Brazil indirect taxes more than offset the poverty-reducing impact of cash transfers. When one includes the effect of in-kind transfers in education and health valued at government costs, they reduce inequality in all countries by considerably more than cash transfers. Spending on public education and health services is broadly pro-poor, with the exception of tertiary education and the health component of the social security system.},
